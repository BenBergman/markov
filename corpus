MOHAMMED was born at Mecca in A

 567 or 569
  His flight (hijra) to Medina, which marks the beginning of the Mohammedan era, took place on 16th June 622
 He died on 7th June 632
    INTRODUCTION  THE Koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religious books of the world
 Though the youngest of the epoch-making works belonging to this class of literature, it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effect which it has produced on large masses of men
 It has created an all but new phase of human thought and a fresh type of character
 It first transformed a number of heterogeneous desert tribes of the Arabian peninsula into a nation of heroes, and then proceeded to create the vast politico-religious organisations of the Muhammedan world which are one of the great forces with which Europe and the East have to reckon to-day
  The secret of the power exercised by the book, of course, lay in the mind which produced it
 It was, in fact, at first not a book, but a strong living voice, a kind of wild authoritative proclamation, a series of admonitions, promises, threats, and instructions addressed to turbulent and largely hostile assemblies of untutored Arabs
 As a book it was published after the prophet's death
 In Muhammed's life-time there were only disjointed notes, speeches, and the retentive memories of those who listened to them
 To speak of the Koran is, therefore, practically the same as speaking of Muhammed, and in trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same time attempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself
 It would indeed be difficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identity between the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it
  That widely different estimates have been formed of Muhammed is well-known
 To Moslems he is, of course, the prophet par excellence, and the Koran is regarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of Allah
 The eulogy pronounced by Carlyle on Muhammed in Heroes and Hero Worship will probably be endorsed by not a few at the present day
 The extreme contrary opinion, which in a fresh form has recently been revived1 by an able writer, is hardly likely to find much lasting support
 The correct view very probably lies between the two extremes
 The relative value of any given system of religious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies as well as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow
 Another important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned to it, for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it, not for that which it borrowed from other systems
  With regard to the first-named criterion, there is a growing opinion among students of religious history that Muhammed may in a real sense be regarded as a prophet of certain truths, though by no means of truth in the absolute meaning of the term
 The shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in the Koran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint with which we are acquainted; but a much more favourable view is arrived at if a comparison is made between the ethics of the Koran and the moral tenets of Arabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted
  The method followed by Muhammed in the promulgation of the Koran also requires to be treated with discrimination
 From the first flash of prophetic inspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the book he, later on, frequently descended to deliberate invention and artful rhetoric
 He, in fact, accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances in which the r\oc\le he had to play involved him
  On the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that the Koran has been thoroughly compared with the Christian and Jewish traditions of the time; and it is, besides some original Arabian legends, to those only that the book stands in any close relationship
 The matter is for the most part borrowed, but the manner is all the prophet's own
 This is emphatically a case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of new materials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of various kinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of the occasion
 Biblical reminiscences, Rabbinic legends, Christian traditions mostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources, and native heathen stories, all first pass through the prophet's fervid mind, and thence issue in strange new forms, tinged with poetry and enthusiasm, and well adapted to enforce his own view of life and duty, to serve as an encouragement to his faithful adherents, and to strike terror into the hearts of his opponents
  There is, however, apart from its religious value, a more general view from which the book should be considered
 The Koran enjoys the distinction of having been the starting-point of a new literary and philosophical movement which has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among both Jews and Christians in the Middle Ages
 This general progress of the Muhammedan world has somehow been arrested, but research has shown that what European scholars knew of Greek philosophy, of mathematics, astronomy, and like sciences, for several centuries before the Renaissance, was, roughly speaking, all derived from Latin treatises ultimately based on Arabic originals; and it was the Koran which, though indirectly, gave the first impetus to these studies among the Arabs and their allies
 Linguistic investigations, poetry, and other branches of literature, also made their appearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the Koran; and the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finest products of genius and learning
  The style in which the Koran is written requires some special attention in this introduction
 The literary form is for the most part different from anything else we know
 In its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voice akin to that of the ancient Hebrew prophets, but there is much in the book which Europeans usually regard as faulty
 The tendency to repetition which is an inherent characteristic of the Semitic mind appears here in an exaggerated form, and there is in addition much in the Koran which strikes us as wild and fantastic
 The most unfavourable criticism ever passed on Muhammed's style has in fact been penned by the prophet's greatest British admirer, Carlyle himself; and there are probably many now who find themselves in the same dilemma with that great writer
  The fault appears, however, to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate the psychology of the Arab prophet
 We must, in order to do him justice, give full consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things around him
 We are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind, trying to realise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have been powerfully borne in upon him, in order to impart them in a convincing form to his fellow-tribesmen
 He is surrounded by obstacles of every kind, yet he manfully struggles on with the message that is within him
 Learning he has none, or next to none
 His chief objects of knowledge are floating stories and traditions largely picked up from hearsay, and his over-wrought mind is his only teacher
 The literary compositions to which he had ever listened were the half-cultured, yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early Arabian minstrels, akin to Ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge
 What wonder then that his Koran took a form which to our colder temperaments sounds strange, unbalanced, and fantastic?  Yet the Moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appeared among men
 They find no incongruity in the style
 To them the matter is all true and the manner all perfect
 Their eastern temperament responds readily to the crude, strong, and wild appeal which its cadences make to them, and the jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end adds to the charm of the whole
 The Koran, even if viewed from the point of view of style alone, was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle, as great a miracle as ever was wrought
  But to return to our own view of the case
 Our difficulty in appreciating the style of the Koran even moderately is, of course, increased if, instead of the original, we have a translation before us
 But one is happy to be able to say that Rodwell's rendering is one of the best that have as yet been produced
 It seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in which Muhammed lived, and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the East
 The quasi-verse form, with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of the lines, which has in suitable cases been adopted, helps to bring out much of the wild charm of the Arabic
 Not the least among its recommendations is, perhaps, that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say, that it aims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole to over-insistence on small details
  Another important merit of Rodwell's edition is its chronological arrangement of the Suras or chapters
 As he tells us himself in his preface, it is now in a number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which a discourse, or part of a discourse, was delivered, so that the system could not be carried through with entire consistency
 But the sequence adopted is in the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence; and in following the order of the chapters as here printed, the reader will be able to trace the development of the prophet's mind as he gradually advanced from the early flush of inspiration to the less spiritual and more equivocal r\oc\le of warrior, politician, and founder of an empire

 LATE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW ZEALAND,  THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED,  WITH SINCERE FEELINGS OF ESTEEM FOR HIS PRIVATE WORTH,  PUBLIC SERVICES,  AND EMINENT LITERARY ATTAINMENTS,  BY      THE TRANSLATOR
    PREFACE  It is necessary that some brief explanation should be given with reference to the arrangement of the Suras, or chapters, adopted in this translation of the Koran
 It should be premised that their order as it stands in all Arabic manuscripts, and in all hitherto printed editions, whether Arabic or European, is not chronological, neither is there any authentic tradition to shew that it rests upon the authority of Muhammad himself
 The scattered fragments of the Koran were in the first instance collected by his immediate successor Abu Bekr, about a year after the Prophet's death, at the suggestion of Omar, who foresaw that, as the Muslim warriors, whose memories were the sole depositaries of large portions of the revelations, died off or were slain, as had been the case with many in the battle of Yemâma, A
H
 12, the loss of the greater part, or even of the whole, was imminent
 Zaid Ibn Thâbit, a native of Medina, and one of the Ansars, or helpers, who had been Muhammad's amanuensis, was the person fixed upon to carry out the task, and we are told that he "gathered together" the fragments of the Koran from every quarter, "from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and from the breasts of men
"1 The copy thus formed by Zaid probably remained in the possession of Abu Bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate, who committed it to the custody of Haphsa, one of Muhammad's widows, and this text continued during the ten years of Omar's caliphate to be the standard
 In the copies made from it, various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up; and these, under the caliphate of Othman, led to such serious disputes between the faithful, that it became necessary to interpose, and in accordance with the warning of Hodzeifa, "to stop the people, before they should differ regarding their scriptures, as did the Jews and Christians
"2 In accordance with this advice, Othman determined to establish a text which should be the sole standard, and entrusted the redaction to the Zaid already mentioned, with whom he associated as colleagues, three, according to others, twelve3 of the Koreisch, in order to secure the purity of that Meccan idiom in which Muhammad had spoken, should any occasions arise in which the collators might have to decide upon various readings
 Copies of the text formed were thus forwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire, and all previously existing copies were committed to the flames
  Zaid and his coadjutors, however, do not appear to have arranged the materials which came into their hands upon any system more definite than that of placing the longest and best known Suras first, immediately after the Fatthah, or opening chapter (the eighth in this edition); although even this rule, artless and unscientific as it is, has not been adhered to with strictness
 Anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirely lost sight of
 Late Medina Suras are often placed before early Meccan Suras; the short Suras at the end of the Koran are its earliest portions; while, as will be seen from the notes, verses of Meccan origin are to be found embedded in Medina Suras, and verses promulged at Medina scattered up and down in the Meccan Suras
 It would seem as if Zaid had to a great extent put his materials together just as they came to hand, and often with entire disregard to continuity of subject and uniformity of style
 The text, therefore, as hitherto arranged, necessarily assumes the form of a most unreadable and incongruous patchwork; "une assemblage," says M
 Kasimirski in his Preface, "informe et incohérent de préceptes moraux, religieux, civils et politiques, mêlés d'exhortations, de promesses, et de menaces"-and conveys no idea whatever of the development and growth of any plan in the mind of the founder of Islam, or of the circumstances by which he was surrounded and influenced
 It is true that the manner in which Zaid contented himself with simply bringing together his materials and transcribing them, without any attempt to mould them into shape or sequence, and without any effort to supply connecting links between adjacent verses, to fill up obvious chasms, or to suppress details of a nature discreditable to the founder of Islam, proves his scrupulous honesty as a compiler, as well as his reverence for the sacred text, and to a certain extent guarantees the genuineness and authenticity of the entire volume
 But it is deeply to be regretted that he did not combine some measure of historical criticism with that simplicity and honesty of purpose which forbade him, as it certainly did, in any way to tamper with the sacred text, to suppress contradictory, and exclude or soften down inaccurate, statements
  The arrangement of the Suras in this translation is based partly upon the traditions of the Muhammadans themselves, with reference especially to the ancient chronological list printed by Weil in his Mohammed der Prophet, as well as upon a careful consideration of the subject matter of each separate Sura and its probable connection with the sequence of events in the life of Muhammad
 Great attention has been paid to this subject by Dr
 Weil in the work just mentioned; by Mr
 Muir in his Life of Mahomet, who also publishes a chronological list of Suras, 21 however of which he admits have "not yet been carefully fixed;" and especially by Nöldeke, in his Geschichte des Qôrans, a work to which public honours were awarded in 1859 by the Paris Academy of Inscriptions
 From the arrangement of this author I see no reason to depart in regard to the later Suras
 It is based upon a searching criticism and minute analysis of the component verses of each, and may be safely taken as a standard, which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons
 I have, however, placed the earlier and more fragmentary Suras, after the two first, in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than to points of historical allusion, which in these Suras are very few; whilst on the other hand, they are mainly couched in the language of self-communion, of aspirations after truth, and of mental struggle, are vivid pictures of Heaven and Hell, or descriptions of natural objects, and refer also largely to the opposition met with by Muhammad from his townsmen of Mecca at the outset of his public career
 This remark applies to what Nöldeke terms "the Suras of the First Period
"  The contrast between the earlier, middle, and later Suras is very striking and interesting, and will be at once apparent from the arrangement here adopted
 In the Suras as far as the 54th, p
 76, we cannot but notice the entire predominance of the poetical element, a deep appreciation (as in Sura xci
 p
 38) of the beauty of natural objects, brief fragmentary and impassioned utterances, denunciations of woe and punishment, expressed for the most part in lines of extreme brevity
 With a change, however, in the position of Muhammad when he openly assumes the office of "public warner," the Suras begin to assume a more prosaic and didactic tone, though the poetical ornament of rhyme is preserved throughout
 We gradually lose the Poet in the missionary aiming to convert, the warm asserter of dogmatic truths; the descriptions of natural objects, of the judgment, of Heaven and Hell, make way for gradually increasing historical statements, first from Jewish, and subsequently from Christian histories; while, in the 29 Suras revealed at Medina, we no longer listen to vague words, often as it would seem without positive aim, but to the earnest disputant with the enemies of his faith, the Apostle pleading the cause of what he believes to be the Truth of God
 He who at Mecca is the admonisher and persuader, at Medina is the legislator and the warrior, who dictates obedience, and uses other weapons than the pen of the Poet and the Scribe
 When business pressed, as at Medina, Poetry makes way for Prose, and although touches of the Poetical element occasionally break forth, and he has to defend himself up to a very late period against the charge of being merely a Poet, yet this is rarely the case in the Medina Suras; and we are startled by finding obedience to God and the Apostle, God's gifts and the Apostle's, God's pleasure and the Apostle's, spoken of in the same breath, and epithets and attributes elsewhere applied to Allah openly applied to himself as in Sura ix
, 118, 129
  The Suras, viewed as a whole, strike me as being the work of one who began his career as a thoughtful enquirer after truth, and an earnest asserter of it in such rhetorical and poetical forms as he deemed most likely to win and attract his countrymen, and who gradually proceeded from the dogmatic teacher to the politic founder of a system for which laws and regulations had to be provided as occasions arose
 And of all the Suras it must be remarked that they were intended not for readers but for hearers-that they were all promulgated by public recital-and that much was left, as the imperfect sentences shew, to the manner and suggestive action of the reciter
 It would be impossible, and indeed it is unnecessary, to attempt a detailed life of Muhammad within the narrow limits of a Preface
 The main events thereof with which the Suras of the Koran stand in connection, are-The visions of Gabriel, seen, or said to have been seen, at the outset of his career in his 40th year, during one of his seasons of annual monthly retirement, for devotion and meditation to Mount Hirâ, near Mecca,-the period of mental depression and re-assurance previous to the assumption of the office of public teacher-the Fatrah or pause (see n
 p
 20) during which he probably waited for a repetition of the angelic vision-his labours in comparative privacy for three years, issuing in about 40 converts, of whom his wife Chadijah was the first, and Abu Bekr the most important: (for it is to him and to Abu Jahl the Sura xcii
 p
 32, refers)-struggles with Meccan unbelief and idolatry followed by a period during which probably he had the second vision, Sura liii
 p
 69, and was listened to and respected as a person "possessed" (Sura lxix
 42, p
 60, lii
 29, p
 64)-the first emigration to Abyssinia in A
D
 616, in consequence of the Meccan persecutions brought on by his now open attacks upon idolatry (Taghout)-increasing reference to Jewish and Christian histories, shewing that much time had been devoted to their study the conversion of Omar in 617-the journey to the Thaquifites at Taief in A
D
 620-the intercourse with pilgrims from Medina, who believed in Islam, and spread the knowledge thereof in their native town, in the same year-the vision of the midnight journey to Jerusalem and the Heavens-the meetings by night at Acaba, a mountain near Mecca, in the 11th year of his mission, and the pledges of fealty there given to him-the command given to the believers to emigrate to Yathrib, henceforth Medinat-en-nabi (the city of the Prophet) or El-Medina (the city), in April of A
D
 622-the escape of Muhammad and Abu Bekr from Mecca to the cave of Thaur-the FLIGHT to Medina in June 20, A
D
 622-treaties made with Christian tribes-increasing, but still very imperfect acquaintance with Christian doctrines-the Battle of Bedr in Hej
 2, and of Ohod-the coalition formed against Muhammad by the Jews and idolatrous Arabians, issuing in the siege of Medina, Hej
 5 (A
D
 627)-the convention, with reference to the liberty of making the pilgrimage, of Hudaibiya, Hej
 6- the embassy to Chosroes King of Persia in the same year, to the Governor of Egypt and to the King of Abyssinia, desiring them to embrace Islam-the conquest of several Jewish tribes, the most important of which was that of Chaibar in Hej
 7, a year marked by the embassy sent to Heraclius, then in Syria, on his return from the Persian campaign, and by a solemn and peaceful pilgrimage to Mecca-the triumphant entry into Mecca in Hej
 8 (A
D
 630), and the demolition of the idols of the Caaba-the submission of the Christians of Nedjran, of Aila on the Red Sea, and of Taief, etc
, in Hej
 9, called "the year of embassies or deputations," from the numerous deputations which flocked to Mecca proffering submission-and lastly in Hej
 10, the submission of Hadramont, Yemen, the greater part of the southern and eastern provinces of Arabia-and the final solemn pilgrimage to Mecca
  While, however, there is no great difficulty in ascertaining the Suras which stand in connection with the more salient features of Muhammad's life, it is a much more arduous, and often impracticable task, to point out the precise events to which individual verses refer, and out of which they sprung
 It is quite possible that Muhammad himself, in a later period of his career, designedly mixed up later with earlier revelations in the same Suras not for the sake of producing that mysterious style which seems so pleasing to the mind of those who value truth least when it is most clear and obvious but for the purpose of softening down some of the earlier statements which represent the last hour and awful judgment as imminent; and thus leading his followers to continue still in the attitude of expectation, and to see in his later successes the truth of his earlier predictions
 If after-thoughts of this kind are to be traced, and they will often strike the attentive reader, it then follows that the perplexed state of the text in individual Suras is to be considered as due to Muhammad himself, and we are furnished with a series of constant hints for attaining to chronological accuracy
 And it may be remarked in passing, that a belief that the end of all things was at hand, may have tended to promote the earlier successes of Islam at Mecca, as it unquestionably was an argument with the Apostles, to flee from "the wrath to come
" It must be borne in mind that the allusions to contemporary minor events, and to the local efforts made by the new religion to gain the ascendant are very few, and often couched in terms so vague and general, that we are forced to interpret the Koran solely by the Koran itself
 And for this, the frequent repetitions of the same histories and the same sentiments, afford much facility: and the peculiar manner in which the details of each history are increased by fresh traits at each recurrence, enables us to trace their growth in the author's mind, and to ascertain the manner in which a part of the Koran was composed
 The absence of the historical element from the Koran as regards the details of Muhammad's daily life, may be judged of by the fact, that only two of his contemporaries are mentioned in the entire volume, and that Muhammad's name occurs but five times, although he is all the way through addressed by the Angel Gabriel as the recipient of the divine revelations, with the word SAY
 Perhaps such passages as Sura ii
 15, p
 339, and v
 246, p
 365, and the constant mention of guidance, direction, wandering, may have been suggested by reminiscences of his mercantile journeys in his earlier years
  It may be considered quite certain that it was not customary to reduce to writing any traditions concerning Muhammad himself for at least the greater part of a century
 They rested entirely on the memory of those who have handed them down, and must necessarily have been coloured by their prejudices and convictions, to say nothing of the tendency to the formation of myths and to actual fabrication, which early shews itself, especially in interpretations of the Koran, to subserve the purposes of the contending factions of the Ommeyads and Abbâsides
 It was under the 5th Caliph, Al- Mâmûn, that three writers (mentioned below) on whom we mainly depend for all really reliable information, flourished: and even their writings are necessarily coloured by the theological tendencies of their master and patron, who was a decided partizan of the divine right of Ali and of his descendants
 The incidents mentioned in the Koran itself, for the interpretation of which early tradition is available, are comparatively few, and there are many passages with which it is totally at variance; as, for instance, that Muhammad worked miracles, which the Koran expressly disclaims
 Traditions can never be considered as at all reliable, unless they are traceable to some common origin, have descended to us by independent witnesses, and correspond with the statements of the Koran itself-always of course deducting such texts as (which is not unfrequently the case) have themselves given rise to the tradition
 It soon becomes obvious to the reader of Muslim traditions and commentators that both miracles and historical events have been invented for the sake of expounding a dark and perplexing text; and that even the earlier traditions are largely tinged with the mythical element
  The first biographer of Muhammad of whom we have any information was Zohri, who died A
H
 124, aged 72; but his works, though abundantly quoted by later writers, are no longer extant
 Much of his information was derived from Orwa, who died A
H
 94, and was a near relative of Ayesha, the prophet's favourite wife
  Ibn Ishaq, who died in A
H
 151, and who had been a hearer of Zohri, composed a Biography of Muhammad for the use of the Caliph Al Mánsûr
 On this work, considerable remains of which have come down to us, Ibn Hisham, who died A
H
 213, based his Life of Muhammad
  Waquidi of Medina, who died A
H
 207, composed a biographical work, which has reached us in an abbreviated form through his secretary (Katib)
 It is composed entirely of traditions
  Tabari, "the Livy of the Arabians" (Gibbon, 51, n
 1), who died at Baghdad A
H
 310, composed annals of Muhammad's life and of the progress of Islam
  These ancient writers are the principal sources whence anything like authentic information as to the life of Muhammad has been derived
 And it may be safely concluded that after the diligent investigations carried on by the professed collectors of traditions in the second century after the Hejira, that little or nothing remains to be added to our stores of information relative to the details of Muhammad's life, or to facts which may further illustrate the text of the Koran
 But however this may be, no records which are posterior in date to these authorities can be considered as at all deserving of dependance
 "To consider," says Dr
 Sprenger, "late historians like Abulfeda as authorities, and to suppose that an account gains in certainty because it is mentioned by several of them, is highly uncritical
" Life of Mohammad, p
 73
  The sources whence Muhammad derived the materials of his Koran are, over and above the more poetical parts, which are his own creation, the legends of his time and country, Jewish traditions based upon the Talmud, or perverted to suit his own purposes, and the floating Christian traditions of Arabia and of S
 Syria
 At a later period of his career no one would venture to doubt the divine origin of the entire book
 But at its commencement the case was different
 The people of Mecca spoke openly and tauntingly of it as the work of a poet, as a collection of antiquated or fabulous legends, or as palpable sorcery
4 They accused him of having confederates, and even specified foreigners who had been his coadjutors
 Such were Salman the Persian, to whom he may have owed the descriptions of Heaven and Hell, which are analogous to those of the Zendavesta; and the Christian monk Sergius, or as the Muhammadans term him, Boheira
 From the latter, and perhaps from other Christians, especially slaves naturalised at Mecca, Muhammad obtained access to the teaching of the Apocryphal Gospels, and to many popular traditions of which those Gospels are the concrete expression
 His wife Chadijah, as well as her cousin Waraka, a reputed convert to Christianity, and Muhammad's intimate friend, are said to have been well acquainted with the doctrines and sacred books both of Jews and Christians
 And not only were several Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of Mecca converts to the Christian faith, but on two occasions Muhammad had travelled with his uncle, Abu Talib, as far as Bostra, where he must have had opportunities of learning the general outlines of Oriental Christian doctrine, and perhaps of witnessing the ceremonial of their worship
 And it appears tolerably certain that previous to and at the period of his entering into public life, there was a large number of enquirers at Mecca, who like Zaid, Omayah of Taief, Waraka, etc
, were dissatisfied equally with the religion of their fathers, the Judaism and the Christianity which they saw around them, and were anxiously enquiring for some better way
 The names and details of the lives of twelve of the "companions" of Muhammad who lived in Mecca, Medina, and Taief, are recorded, who previous to his assumption of the Prophetic office, called themselves Hanyfs, i
e
, converts, puritans, and were believers in one God, and regarded Abraham as the founder of their religion
 Muhammad publicly acknowledged that he was a Hanyf-and this sect of the Hanyfites (who are in no way to be confounded with the later sect of the same name) were among his Meccan precursors
 See n
 pp
 209, 387
 Their history is to be found in the Fihrist- MS
 Paris, anc
 fonds, nr
 874 (and in other treatises)-which Dr
 Sprenger believes to have been in the library of the Caliph El-Mâmûn
 In this treatise, the Hanyfs are termed Sabeites, and said to have received the Volumes (Sohof) or Books of Abraham, mentioned in Sura lxxxvii
 19, p
 40, 41, which most commentators affirm to have been borrowed from them, as is also the case with the latter part of Sura liii
 37, ad f
 p
 71; so that from these "Books" Muhammad derived the legends of Ad and Themoud, whose downfall, recent as it was (see note p
 300), he throws back to a period previous to that of Moses, who is made to ask (Sura xiv
 9, p
 226) "whether their history had reached his hearers
" Muhammad is said to have discovered these "Books" to be a recent forgery, and that this is the reason why no mention of them occurs after the fourth year of his Prophetic function, A
D
 616
 Hence too, possibly, the title Hanyf was so soon dropped and exchanged for that of Muslim, one who surrenders or resigns himself to God
 The Waraka above mentioned, and cousin of Chadijah, is said to have believed on Muhammad as long as he continued true to the principles of the Hanyfs, but to have quitted him in disgust at his subsequent proceedings, and to have died an orthodox Christian
  It has been supposed that Muhammad derived many of his notions concerning Christianity from Gnosticism, and that it is to the numerous gnostic sects the Koran alludes when it reproaches the Christians with having "split up their religion into parties
" But for Muhammad thus to have confounded Gnosticism with Christianity itself, its prevalence in Arabia must have been far more universal than we have any reason to believe it really was
 In fact, we have no historical authority for supposing that the doctrines of these heretics were taught or professed in Arabia at all
 It is certain, on the other hand, that the Basilidans, Valentinians, and other gnostic sects had either died out, or been reabsorbed into the orthodox Church, towards the middle of the fifth century, and had disappeared from Egypt before the sixth
 It is nevertheless possible that the gnostic doctrine concerning the Crucifixion was adopted by Muhammad as likely to reconcile the Jews to Islam, as a religion embracing both Judaism and Christianity, if they might believe that Jesus had not been put to death, and thus find the stumbling-block of the atonement removed out of their path
 The Jews would in this case have simply been called upon to believe in Jesus as being what the Koran represents him, a holy teacher, who, like the patriarch Enoch or the prophet Elijah, had been miraculously taken from the earth
 But, in all other respects, the sober and matter-of-fact statements of the Koran relative to the family and history of Jesus, are altogether opposed to the wild and fantastic doctrines of Gnostic emanations, and especially to the manner in which they supposed Jesus, at his Baptism, to have been brought into union with a higher nature
 It is quite clear that Muhammad borrowed in several points from the doctrines of the Ebionites, Essenes, and Sabeites
 Epiphanius (H‘r
 x
) describes the notions of the Ebionites of Nabath‘a, Moabitis, and Basanitis with regard to Adam and Jesus, almost in the very words of Sura iii
 52
 He tells us that they observed circumcision, were opposed to celibacy, forbad turning to the sunrise, but enjoined Jerusalem as their Kebla (as did Muhammad during twelve years), that they prescribed (as did the Sabeites), washings, very similar to those enjoined in the Koran, and allowed oaths (by certain natural objects, as clouds, signs of the Zodiac, oil, the winds, etc
), which we find adopted in the Koran
 These points of contact with Islam, knowing as we do Muhammad's eclecticism, can hardly be accidental
  We have no evidence that Muhammad had access to the Christian Scriptures, though it is just possible that fragments of the Old or New Testament may have reached him through Chadijah or Waraka, or other Meccan Christians, possessing MSS
 of the sacred volume
 There is but one direct quotation (Sura xxi
 105) in the whole Koran from the Scriptures; and though there are a few passages, as where alms are said to be given to be seen of men, and as, none forgiveth sins but God only, which might seem to be identical with texts of the New Testament, yet this similarity is probably merely accidental
 It is, however, curious to compare such passages as Deut
 xxvi
 14, 17; 1 Peter v
 2, with Sura xxiv
 50, p
 448, and x
 73, p
 281 John vii
 15, with the "illiterate" Prophet-Matt
 xxiv
 36, and John xii
 27, with the use of the word hour as meaning any judgment or crisis, and The last judgment-the voice of the Son of God which the dead are to hear, with the exterminating or awakening cry of Gabriel, etc
 The passages of this kind, with which the Koran abounds, result from Muhammad's general acquaintance with Scriptural phraseology, partly through the popular legends, partly from personal intercourse with Jews and Christians
 And we may be quite certain that whatever materials Muhammad may have derived from our Scriptures, directly or indirectly, were carefully recast
 He did not even use its words without due consideration
 For instance, except in the phrase "the Lord of the worlds," he seems carefully to have avoided the expression the Lord, probably because it was applied by the Christians to Christ, or to God the Father
  It should also be borne in mind that we have no traces of the existence of Arabic versions of the Old or New Testament previous to the time of Muhammad
 The passage of St
 Jerome-"Hæc autem translatio nullum de veteribus sequitur interpretem; sed ex ipso Hebraico, Arabicoque sermone, et interdum Syro, nunc verba, nunc sensum, nunc simul utrumque resonabit," (Prol
 Gal
) obviously does not refer to versions, but to idiom
 The earliest Ar
 version of the Old Testament, of which we have any knowledge, is that of R
 Saadias Gaon, A
D
 900; and the oldest Ar
 version of the New Testament, is that published by Erpenius in 1616, and transcribed in the Thebais, in the year 1171, by a Coptic Bishop, from a copy made by a person whose name is known, but whose date is uncertain
 Michaelis thinks that the Arabic versions of the New Testament were made between the Saracen conquests in the seventh century, and the Crusades in the eleventh century-an opinion in which he follows, or coincides with, Walton (Prol
 in Polygl
 § xiv
) who remarks-"Plane constat versionem Arabicam apud eas (ecclesias orientales) factam esse postquam lingua Arabica per victorias et religionem Muhammedanicam per Orientem propagata fuerat, et in multis locis facta esset vernacula
" If, indeed, in these comparatively late versions, the general phraseology, especially in the histories common to the Scriptures and to the Koran, bore any similarity to each other, and if the orthography of the proper names had been the same in each, it might have been fair to suppose that such versions had been made, more or less, upon the basis of others, which, though now lost, existed in the ages prior to Muhammad, and influenced, if they did not directly form, his sources of information
 But5 this does not appear to be the case
 The phraseology of our existing versions is not that of the Koran-and these versions appear to have been made from the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and Greek; the four Gospels, says Tischendorf6 originem mixtam habere videntur
  From the Arab Jews, Muhammad would be enabled to derive an abundant, though most distorted, knowledge of the Scripture histories
 The secrecy in which he received his instructions from them, and from his Christian informants, enabled him boldly to declare to the ignorant pagan Meccans that God had revealed those Biblical histories to him
 But there can be no doubt, from the constant identity between the Talmudic perversions of Scripture histories and Rabbinic moral precepts, that the Rabbins of the Hejaz communicated their legends to Muhammad
 And it should be remembered that the Talmud was completed a century previous to the era of Muhammad,7 and cannot fail to have extensively influenced the religious creed of all the Jews of the Arabian peninsula
 In one passage,8 Muhammad speaks of an individual Jew-perhaps some one of note among his professed followers, as a witness to his mission; and there can be no doubt that his relations with the Jews were, at one time, those of friendship and intimacy, when we find him speak of their recognising him as they do their own children, and hear him blaming their most colloquial expressions
9 It is impossible, however, for us at this distance of time to penetrate the mystery in which this subject is involved
 Yet certain it is, that, although their testimony against Muhammad was speedily silenced, the Koreisch knew enough of his private history to disbelieve and to disprove his pretensions of being the recipient of a divine revelation, and that they accused him of writing from the dictation of teachers morning and evening
10 And it is equally certain, that all the information received by Muhammad was embellished and recast in his own mind and with his own words
 There is a unity of thought, a directness and simplicity of purpose, a peculiar and laboured style, a uniformity of diction, coupled with a certain deficiency of imaginative power, which proves the ayats (signs or verses) of the Koran at least to be the product of a single pen
 The longer narratives were, probably, elaborated in his leisure hours, while the shorter verses, each claiming to be a sign or miracle, were promulgated as occasion required them
 And, whatever Muhammad may himself profess in the Koran11 as to his ignorance, even of reading and writing, and however strongly modern Muhammadans may insist upon the same point an assertion by the way contradicted by many good authors12-there can be no doubt that to assimilate and work up his materials, to fashion them into elaborate Suras, to fit them for public recital, must have been a work requiring much time, study, and meditation, and presumes a far greater degree of general culture than any orthodox Muslim will be disposed to admit
  In close connection with the above remarks, stands the question of Muhammad's sincerity and honesty of purpose in coming forward as a messenger from God
 For if he was indeed the illiterate person the Muslims represent him to have been, then it will be hard to escape their inference that the Koran is, as they assert it to be, a standing miracle
 But if, on the other hand, it was a Book carefully concocted from various sources, and with much extraneous aid, and published as a divine oracle, then it would seem that the author is at once open to the charge of the grossest imposture, and even of impious blasphemy
 The evidence rather shews, that in all he did and wrote, Muhammad was actuated by a sincere desire to deliver his countrymen from the grossness of its debasing idolatries-that he was urged on by an intense desire to proclaim that great truth of the Unity of the Godhead which had taken full possession of his own soul-that the end to be attained justified to his mind the means he adopted in the production of his Suras-that he worked himself up into a belief that he had received a divine call-and that he was carried on by the force of circumstances, and by gradually increasing successes, to believe himself the accredited messenger of Heaven
 The earnestness of those convictions which at Mecca sustained him under persecution, and which perhaps led him, at any price as it were, and by any means, not even excluding deceit and falsehood, to endeavour to rescue his countrymen from idolatry,-naturally stiffened at Medina into tyranny and unscrupulous violence
 At the same time, he was probably, more or less, throughout his whole career, the victim of a certain amount of self-deception
 A cataleptic13 subject from his early youth, born-according to the traditions-of a highly nervous and excitable mother, he would be peculiarly liable to morbid and fantastic hallucinations, and alternations of excitement and depression, which would win for him, in the eyes of his ignorant countrymen, the credit of being inspired
 It would be easy for him to persuade himself that he was "the seal of the Prophets," the proclaimer of a doctrine of the Divine Unity, held and taught by the Patriarchs, especially by Abraham-a doctrine that should present to mankind Judaism divested of its Mosaic ceremonial, and Christianity divested of the Atonement and the Trinity14-doctrine, as he might have believed, fitted and destined to absorb Judaism, Christianity, and Idolatry; and this persuasion, once admitted into his mind as a conviction, retained possession of it, and carried him on, though often in the use of means, towards the end of his career, far different from those with which he commenced it, to a victorious consummation
 It is true that the state of Arabia previous to the time of Muhammad was one of preparedness for a new religion that the scattered elements were there, and wanted only the mind of a master to harmonise and enforce them and that Islam was, so to speak, a necessity of the time
15 Still Muhammad's career is a wonderful instance of the force and life that resides in him who possesses an intense Faith in God and in the unseen world; and whatever deductions may be made-and they are many and serious-from the noble and truthful in his character, he will always be regarded as one of those who have had that influence over the faith, morals, and whole earthly life of their fellow-men, which none but a really great man ever did, or can, exercise; and as one of those, whose efforts to propagate some great verity will prosper, in spite of manifold personal errors and defects, both of principle and character
  The more insight we obtain, from undoubted historical sources, into the actual character of Muhammad, the less reason do we find to justify the strong vituperative language poured out upon his head by Maracci, Prideaux, and others, in recent days, one of whom has found, in the Byzantine "Maometis," the number of the Beast (Rev
 xii)! It is nearer to the truth to say that he was a great though imperfect character, an earnest though mistaken teacher, and that many of his mistakes and imperfections were the result of circumstances, of temperament, and constitution; and that there must be elements both of truth and goodness in the system of which he was the main author, to account for the world-wide phenomenon, that whatever may be the intellectual inferiority (if such is, indeed, the fact) of the Muslim races, the influence of his teaching, aided, it is true, by the vast impulse given to it by the victorious arms of his followers, has now lasted for nearly thirteen centuries, and embraces more than one hundred millions of our race-more than one-tenth part of the inhabitants of the globe
  It must be acknowledged, too, that the Koran deserves the highest praise for its conceptions of the Divine nature, in reference to the attributes of Power, Knowledge, and universal Providence and Unity-that its belief and trust in the One God of Heaven and Earth is deep and fervent-and that, though it contains fantastic visions and legends, teaches a childish ceremonial, and justifies bloodshedding, persecution, slavery, and polygamy, yet that at the same time it embodies much of a noble and deep moral earnestness, and sententious oracular wisdom, and has proved that there are elements in it on which mighty nations, and conquering though not, perhaps, durable-empires can be built up
 It is due to the Koran, that the occupants in the sixth century of an arid peninsula, whose poverty was only equalled by their ignorance, become not only the fervent and sincere votaries of a new creed, but, like Amru and many more, its warlike propagators
 Impelled possibly by drought and famine, actuated partly by desire of conquest, partly by religious convictions, they had conquered Persia in the seventh century, the northern coasts of Africa, and a large portion of Spain in the eighth, the Punjaub and nearly the whole of India in the ninth
 The simple shepherds and wandering Bedouins of Arabia, are transformed, as if by a magician's wand, into the founders of empires, the builders of cities, the collectors of more libraries than they at first destroyed, while cities like Fostât, Baghdad, Cordova, and Delhi, attest the power at which Christian Europe trembled
 And thus, while the Koran, which underlays this vast energy and contains the principles which are its springs of action, reflects to a great extent the mixed character of its author, its merits as a code of laws, and as a system of religious teaching, must always be estimated by the changes which it introduced into the customs and beliefs of those who willingly or by compulsion embraced it
 In the suppression of their idolatries, in the substitution of the worship of Allah for that of the powers of nature and genii with Him, in the abolition of child murder, in the extinction of manifold superstitious usages, in the reduction of the number of wives to a fixed standard, it was to the Arabians an unquestionable blessing, and an accession, though not in the Christian sense a Revelation, of Truth; and while every Christian must deplore the overthrow of so many flourishing Eastern churches by the arms of the victorious Muslims, it must not be forgotten that Europe, in the middle ages, owed much of her knowledge of dialectic philosophy, of medicine, and architecture, to Arabian writers, and that Muslims formed the connecting link between the West and the East for the importation of numerous articles of luxury and use
 That an immense mass of fable and silly legend has been built up upon the basis of the Koran is beyond a doubt, but for this Muhammad is not answerable, any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses of his followers in after ages
 I agree with Sale in thinking that, "how criminal soever Muhammad may have been in imposing a false religion on mankind, the praises due to his real virtues ought not to be denied him" (Preface), and venture to think that no one can rise from the perusal of his Koran without argeeing with that motto from St
 Augustin, which Sale has prefixed to his title page, "Nulla falsa doctrina est, quæ non aliquid veri permisceat
" Qu‘st

 The translations of Sale, Ullmann, Wahl, Hammer von Purgstall in the Fundgruben des Orients, and M
 Kasimirski, have been collated throughout; and above all, the great work of Father Maracci, to whose accuracy and research search Sale's work mainly owes its merits
 Sale has, however, followed Maracci too closely, especially by introducing his paraphrastic comments into the body of the text, as well as by his constant use of Latinised instead of Saxon words
 But to Sale's "Preliminary Discourse" the reader is referred, as to a storehouse of valuable information; as well as to the works of Geiger, Gerock, and Freytag, and to the lives of Muhammad by Dr
 Weil, Mr
 Muir, and that of Dr
 Sprenger now issuing from the press, in German
 The more brief and poetical verses of the earlier Suras are translated with a freedom from which I have altogether abstained in the historical and prosaic portions; but I have endeavoured nowhere to use a greater amount of paraphrase than is necessary to convey the sense of the original
 "Vel verbum e verbo," says S
 Jerome (Præf
 in Jobum) of versions, "vel sensum e sensu, vel ex utroque commixtum, et medie temperatum genus translationis
" The proper names are usually given as in our Scriptures: the English reader would not easily recognise Noah as Nûh, Lot as Lût, Moses as Musa, Abraham as Ibrahym, Pharaoh as Firaun, Aaron as Harun, Jesus as Isa, John as Yahia, etc
; and it has been thought best to give different renderings of the same constantly recurring words and phrases, in order more fully to convey their meaning
 For instance, the Arabic words which mean Companions of the fire, are also rendered inmates of, etc
, given up to, etc
; the People of the Book, i
e
 Jews, Christians and Sabeites, is sometimes retained, sometimes paraphrased
 This remark applies to such words as tanzyl, lit
 downsending or Revelation; zikr, the remembrance or constant repetition or mention of God's name as an act of devotion; saha, the Hour of present or final judgment; and various epithets of Allah
  I have nowhere attempted to represent the rhymes of the original
 The "Proben" of H
 v
 Purgstall, in the Fundgruben des Orients, excellent as they are in many respects, shew that this can only be done with a sacrifice of literal translation
 I subjoin as a specimen Lieut
 Burton's version of the Fatthah, or opening chapter of previous editions

 28

  "I have endeavoured," he adds, "in this translation to imitate the imperfect rhyme of the original Arabic
 Such an attempt, however, is full of difficulties
 The Arabic is a language in which, like Italian, it is almost impossible not to rhyme

  14  A line of argument to be adopted by a Christian missionary in dealing with a Muhammadan should be, not to attack Islam as a mass of error, but to shew that it contains fragments of disjointed truth-that it is based upon Christianity and Judaism partially understood-especially upon the latter, without any appreciation of its typical character pointing to Christianity as a final dispensation

 361- 363
 It is understood by the Muhammadan commentators to have a primary reference to the succession of subjects or parts, like the rows of bricks in a wall
 The titles of the Suras are generally taken from some word occurring in each, which is printed in large type throughout, where practicable
  2 This formula-Bismillahi 'rrahmani 'rrahim-is of Jewish origin
 It was in the first instance taught to the Koreisch by Omayah of Taief, the poet, who was a contemporary with, but somewhat older than, Muhammad; and who, during his mercantile journeys into Arabia Petr‘a and Syria, had made himself acquainted with the sacred books and doctrines of Jews and Christians
 (Kitab al-Aghâni, 16
 Delhi
) Muhammad adopted and constantly used it, and it is prefixed to each Sura except the ninth
 The former of the two epithets implies that the mercy of God is exercised as occasions arise, towards all his creatures; the latter that the quality of mercy is inherent in God and permanent, so that there is only a shade of difference between the two words
 Maracci well renders, In Nomine Dei Miseratoris, Misericordis
 The rendering I have adopted is that of Mr
 Lane in his extracts from the Koran
 See also Freytag's Lex
 ii
 p
 133
 Perhaps, In the name of Allah, the God of Mercy, the Merciful, would more fully express the original Arabic
 The first five verses of this Sura are, in the opinion of nearly all commentators, ancient and modern, the earliest revelations made to Muhammad, in the 40th year of his life, and the starting point of El-Islam
 (See the authorities quoted in detail in Nöldeke's Geschichte des Qorâns, p
 62, n
)  3 The usual rendering is read
 But the word qaraa, which is the root of the word Koran, analogous to the Rabbinic mikra, rather means to address, recite; and with regard to its etymology and use in the kindred dialects to call, cry aloud, proclaim
 Compare Isai
 lviii
 1; 1 Kings xviii
 37; and Gesen
 Thesaur
 on the Hebrew root
 I understand this passage to mean, "Preach to thy fellow men what thou believest to be true of thy Lord who has created man from the meanest materials, and can in like manner prosper the truth which thou proclaimest
 He has taught man the art of writing (recently introduced at Mecca) and in this thou wilt find a powerful help for propagating the knowledge of the divine Unity
" The speaker in this, as in all the Suras, is Gabriel, of whom Muhammad had, as he believed, a vision on the mountain Hirâ, near Mecca
 See note 1 on the next page
 The details of the vision are quite unhistorical
  4 This, and the following verses, may have been added at a later period, though previous to the Flight, and with special reference, if we are to believe the commentators Beidhawi, etc
, to the opposition which Muhammad experienced at the hands of his opponent, Abu Jahl, who had threatened to set his foot on the Prophet's neck when prostrate in prayer
 But the whole passage admits of application to mankind in general
  5 That is Muhammad
 Nöldeke, however, proposes to render "a slave
" And it is certain that the doctrines of Islam were in the first instance embraced by slaves, many of whom had been carried away from Christian homes, or born of Christian parents at Mecca
 "Men of this description," says Dr
 Sprenger (Life of Mohammad
 Allahabad
 p
 159), "no doubt prepared the way for the Islam by inculcating purer notions respecting God upon their masters and their brethren
 These men saw in Mohammad their liberator; and being superstitious enough to consider his fits as the consequence of an inspiration, they were among the first who acknowledged him as a prophet
 Many of them suffered torture for their faith in him, and two of them died as martyrs
 The excitement among the slaves when Mohammad first assumed his office was so great, that Abd Allah bin Jod'an, who had one hundred of these sufferers, found it necessary to remove them from Makkah, lest they should all turn converts
" See Sura xvi

  7 The principal men of the Koreisch who adhered to Abu Jahl
  8 During a period variously estimated from six months to three years from the revelation of this Sura, or of its earliest verses, the prophetic inspiration and the revelation of fresh Suras is said to have been suspended
 This interval is called the Fatrah or intermission; and the Meccan Suras delivered at its close show that at or during this period Muhammad had gained an increasing and more intimate acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian Scriptures
 "The accounts, however," says Mr
 Muir (vol
 ii
 86) "are throughout confused, if not contradictory; and we can only gather with certainty that there was a time during which his mind hung in suspense, and doubted the divine mission
" The idea of any supernatural influence is of course to be entirely excluded; although there is no doubt that Muhammad himself had a full belief in the personality and influence of Satans and Djinn
 Profound meditation, the struggles of an earnest mind anxious to attain to truth, the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject, visions seen in epileptic swoons, disgust at Meccan idolatry, and a desire to teach his countrymen the divine Unity will sufficiently account for the period of indecision termed the Fatrah, and for the determination which led Muhammad, in all sincerity, but still self-deceived, to take upon himself the office and work of a Messenger from God
 We may perhaps infer from such passages as Sura ii
 123, what had ever been the leading idea in Muhammad's mind
   SURA LXXIV
-THE ENWRAPPED1 [II
]  MECCA
-55 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O THOU, ENWRAPPED in thy mantle!  Arise and warn!  Thy Lord-magnify Him!  Thy raiment-purify it!  The abomination-flee it!  And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase;  And for thy Lord wait thou patiently
  For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet,2  That shall be a distressful day,  A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease
  Leave me alone to deal with him3 whom I have created,  And on whom I have bestowed vast riches,  And sons dwelling before him,  And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down;-  Yet desireth he that I should add more!  But no!  because to our signs he is a foe  I will lay grievous woes upon him
  For he plotted and he planned!  May he be cursed!  How he planned!  Again, may he be cursed!  How he planned!  Then looked he around him,  Then frowned and scowled,  Then turned his back and swelled with disdain,  And said, “This is merely magic that will be wrought;  It is merely the word of a mortal
”  We will surely cast him into Hell-fire
  And who shall teach thee what Hell-fire is?  It leaveth nought, it spareth nought,  Blackening the skin
  Over it are nineteen angels
  None but angels have we made guardians of the fire:4 nor have we made this to be their number but to perplex the unbelievers, and that they who possess the Scriptures may be certain of the truth of the Koran, and that they who believe may increase their faith;  And that they to whom the Scriptures have been given, and the believers, may not doubt;  And that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say, What meaneth God by this parable?  Thus God misleadeth whom He will, and whom He will doth He guide aright: and none knoweth the armies of thy Lord but Himself: and this is no other than a warning to mankind
  Nay, by the Moon!  By the Night when it retreateth!  By the Morn when it brighteneth!  Hell is one of the most grievous woes,  Fraught with warning to man,  To him among you who desireth to press forward, or to remain behind
5  For its own works lieth every soul in pledge
  But they of God’s right hand  In their gardens shall ask of the wicked;-  “What hath cast you into Hell-fire?”6  They will say, “We were not of those who prayed,  And we were not of those who fed the poor,  And we plunged into vain disputes with vain disputers,  And we rejected as a lie, the day of reckoning,  Till the certainty7 came upon us”-  And intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
  Then what hath come to them that they turn aside from the Warning  As if they were affrighted asses fleeing from a lion?  And every one of them would fain have open pages given to him out of Heaven
  It shall not be
  They fear not the life to come
  It shall not be
  For this Koran is warning enough
  And whoso will, it warneth him
  But not unless God please, shall they be warned
  Meet is He to be feared
 Meet is forgiveness in Him
   _______________________  1 This Sura is placed by Muir in the “second stage” of Meccan Suras, and twenty-first in chronological order, in the third or fourth year of the Prophet’s career
  According, however, to the chronological list of Suras given by Weil (Leben M
 p
 364) from ancient tradition, as well as from the consentient voice of tradionists and commentaries (v
 Nöld
 Geschichte, p
 69; Sprenger’s Life of Mohammad, p
 111) it was the next revealed after the Fatrah, and the designation to the prophetic office
  The main features of the tradition are, that Muhammad while wandering about in the hills near Mecca, distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth, had a vision of the Angel Gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth, that he ran to his wife, Chadijah, in the greatest alarm, and desired her, perhaps from superstitious motives (and believing that if covered with clothes he should be shielded from the glances of evil spirits-comp
 Stanley on I Cor
 xi
 10), to envelope him in his mantle; that then Gabriel came down and addressed him as in v
 I
  This vision, like that which preceded Sura xcvi
, may actually have occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits from which Muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered
  Hence Muhammad in Sura lxxxi
 appeals to it as a matter of fact, and such he doubtless believe it to be
  It may here be observed, that however absurd the Muslim traditions may be in many of their details, it will generally be found that where there is an ancient and tolerably universal consent, there will be found at the bottom a residuum of fact and historical truth
  At the same time there can be no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly founded upon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of the Koran, and are pure inventions of a later age
  2 The Arabic words are not those used in later Suras to express the same idea
  3  Said to be Walid b
 Mogheira, a person of note among the unbelieving Meccans
  This portion of the Sura seems to be of a different date from the first seven verses, though very ancient, and the change of subject is similar to that at v

 THE ENFOLDED1 [III
]  MECCA
 20 Verses
  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O THOU ENFOLDED in thy mantle,  Stand up all night, except a small portion of it, for prayer:  Half; or curtail the half a little,-  Or add to it: And with measured tone intone the Koran,2  For we shall devolve on thee weighty words
  Verily, at the oncoming of night are devout impressions strongest, and words are most collected;3  But in the day time thou hast continual employ-  And commemorate the name of thy Lord, and devote thyself to Him with entire devotion
  Lord of the East and of the West! No God is there but He! Take Him for thy protector,  And endure what they say with patience, and depart from them with a decorous departure
  And let Me alone with the gainsayers, rich in the pleasures of this life; and bear thou with them yet a little while:  For with Us are strong fetters, and a flaming fire,  And food that choketh, and a sore torment
  The day cometh when the earth and the mountains shall be shaken; and the mountains shall become a loose sand heap
  Verily, we have sent you an Apostle to witness against you, even as we sent an Apostle to Pharaoh:  But Pharaoh rebelled against the Apostle, and we therefore laid hold on him with a severe chastisement
  And how, if ye believe not, will you screen yourselves from the day that shall turn children greyheaded?  The very heaven shall be reft asunder by it: this threat shall be carried into effect
  Lo! this is a warning
 Let him then who will, take the way to his Lord
  Of a truth,4 thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest almost two-thirds, or half, or a third of the night, as do a part of thy followers
 But God measureth the night and the day:  He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and therefore, turneth to you mercifully
 Recite then so much of the Koran as may be easy to you
 He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others do battle in his cause
 Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy
 And observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms,5 and lend God a liberal loan: for whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof, ye shall find with God
 This will be best and richest in the recompense
 And seek the forgiveness of God: verily, God is forgiving, Merciful
   _______________________  1 From the first line of this Sura, and its expressions concerning the Koran, Prayer, and Future Punishment: from the similarity of the tradition with regard to its having been preceded by a vision of Gabriel (Beidh
, etc
), it seems to belong to, or at least to describe, a period, perhaps immediately succeeding the Fatrah, during which the hours of night were spent by Muhammad in devotion and in the labour of working up his materials in rhythmical and rhyming Suras, and in preparation for the public assumption of the prophetic office

 The words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar to the Meccans, especially to that numerous body who were anxiously searching after some better religion than the idolatries of their fathers (v

-11 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  BY the noon-day BRIGHTNESS,  And by the night when it darkeneth!  Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither hath he been displeased
  And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past,  And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied
  Did he not find thee an orphan2 and gave thee a home?  And found thee erring and guided thee,3  And found thee needy and enriched thee
  As to the orphan therefore wrong him not;  And as to him that asketh of thee, chide him not away;  And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad
   _______________________  1 This and the six following Suras are expressions of a state of deep mental anxiety and depression, in which Muhammad seeks to reassure himself by calling to mind the past favours of God, and by fixing his mind steadfastly on the Divine Unity
 They belong to a period either before the public commencement of his ministry or when his success was very dubious, and his future career by no means clearly marked out

  Guide Thou us on the straight path,2  The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;-with whom thou art not angry, and who go not astray
3   _______________________  1 This Sura, which Nöldeke places last, and Muir sixth, in the earliest class of Meccan Suras, must at least have been composed prior to Sura xxxvii
 182,where it is quoted, and to Sura xv
 87, which refers to it
 And it can scarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second, and fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period as given by N”ldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it therefore, in N”ldeke, opinion, immediately precedes
 But this may be accounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and public devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of the Muhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice
  It should also be observed that, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same number of petitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer
 It is recited several times in each of the five daily prayers, and on many other occassions, as in concluding a bargain, etc
 It is termed "the Opening of the Book," "the Completion," "the Sufficing Sura," the Sura of Praise, Thanks, and Prayer," "the Healer," "the Remedy," "the Basis," "the Treasure," "the Mother of the Book," "the Seven Verses of Repetition
" The Muhammadans always say "Amen" after this prayer, Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so by the Angel Gabriel

1 By the PEN2 and by what they write,  Thou, O Prophet; by the grace of thy Lord art not possessed!3  And truly a boundless recompense doth await thee,  For thou art of a noble nature
4  But thou shalt see and they shall see Which of you is the demented
  Now thy Lord! well knoweth He the man who erreth from his path, and well doth he know those who have yielded to Guidance;  Give not place, therefore, to those who treat thee as a liar:  They desire thee to deal smoothly with them: then would they be smooth as oil with thee:  But yield not to the man of oaths, a despicable person,  Defamer, going about with slander,  Hinderer of the good, transgressor, criminal,  Harsh-beside this, impure by birth,  Though a man of riches and blessed with sons
  Who when our wondrous verses are recited to him saith-"Fables of the ancients
"  We will brand him on the nostrils
  Verily, we have proved them (the Meccans) as we proved the owners of the garden, when they swore that at morn they would cut its fruits;  But added no reserve
5  Wherefore an encircling desolation from thy Lord swept round it while they slumbered,  And in the morning it was like a garden whose fruits had all been cut
  Then at dawn they called to each other,  "Go out early to your field, if ye would cut your dates
"  So on they went whispering to each other,  "No poor man shall set foot this day within your garden;"  And they went out at daybreak with this settled purpose
  But when they beheld it, they said, "Truly we have been in fault:  Yes! we are forbidden our fruits
"  The most rightminded of them said, "Did I not say to you, Will ye not give praise to God?"  They said, "Glory to our Lord! Truly we have done amiss
"  And they fell to blaming one another:  They said, "Oh woe to us! we have indeed transgressed!  Haply our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: verily we crave it of our Lord
"  Such hath been our chastisement-but heavier shall be the chastisement of the next world
 Ah! did they but know it
  Verily, for the God-fearing are gardens of delight in the presence of their Lord
  Shall we then deal with those who have surrendered themselves to God, as with those who offend him?  What hath befallen you that ye thus judge?  Have ye a Scripture wherein ye can search out  That ye shall have the things ye choose?  Or have ye received oaths which shall bind Us even until the day of the resurrection, that ye shall have what yourselves judge right?  Ask them which of them will guarantee this?  Or is it that they have joined gods with God? let them produce those associate-gods of theirs, if they speak truth
  On the day when men's legs shall be bared,6 and they shall be called upon to bow in adoration, they shall not be able:  Their looks shall be downcast: shame shall cover them: because, while yet in safety, they were invited to bow in worship, but would not obey
  Leave me alone therefore with him who chargeth this revelation with imposture
 We will lead them by degrees to their ruin; by ways which they know not;  Yet will I bear long with them; for my plan is sure
  Askest thou any recompense from them? But they are burdened with debt
  Are the secret things within their ken? Do they copy them from the Book of God?  Patiently then await the judgment of thy Lord, and be not like him who was in the fish,7 when in deep distress he cried to God
  Had not favour from his Lord reached him, cast forth would he have been on the naked shore, overwhelmed with shame:  But his Lord chose him and made him of the just
  Almost would the infidels strike thee down with their very looks when they hear the warning of the Koran
 And they say, "He is certainly possessed
"  Yet is it nothing less than a warning for all creatures
   _______________________  1 It has been conjectured that as the word Nun means fish, there may be a reference to the fish which swallowed Jonas (v
 48)
 The fact, however, is that the meaning of this and of the similar symbols, throughout the Koran, was unknown to the Muhammadans themselves even in the first century
 Possibly the letters Ha, Mim, which are prefixed to numerous successive Suras were private marks, or initial letters, attached by their proprietor to the copies furnished to Said when effecting his recension of the text under Othman
 In the same way, the letters prefixed to other Suras may be monograms, or abbreviations, or initial letters of the names of the persons to whom the copies of the respective Suras belonged
  addenda: The symbol nun may possibly refer to this letter as forming the Rhyme in most of the verses of this Sura

 But this opinion probably originated from the expression in v

 Verses 17-33 read like a later addition, and this passage, as well as verse 48-50, has been classed with the Medina revelations

And he sent against them birds in flocks (ababils),  Claystones did they hurl down upon them,  And he made them like stubble eaten down!   _______________________  1 This Sura is probably Muhammad's appeal to the Meccans, intended at the same time for his own encouragement, on the ground of their deliverance from the army of Abraha, the Christian King of Abyssinia and Arabia Felix, said to have been lost in the year of Muhammad's birth in an expedition against Mecca for the purpose of destroying the Caaba
 This army was cut off by small-pox (Wakidi; Hishami), and there is no doubt, as the Arabic word for small-pox also means "small stones," in reference to the hard gravelly feeling of the pustules, what is the true interpretation of the fourth line of this Sura, which, like many other poetical passages in the Koran, has formed the starting point for the most puerile and extravagant legends

As to him who is wealthy-  To him thou wast all attention:  Yet is it not thy concern if he be not cleansed:2  But as to him who cometh to thee in earnest,  And full of fears-  Him dost thou neglect
  Nay! but it (the Koran) is a warning;  (And whoso is willing beareth it in mind)  Written on honoured pages,  Exalted, purified,  By the hands of Scribes, honoured, righteous
  Cursed be man! What hath made him unbelieving?  Of what thing did God create him?  Out of moist germs

  Aye! but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his Lord
  Let man look at his food:  It was We who rained down the copious rains,  Then cleft the earth with clefts,  And caused the upgrowth of the grain,  And grapes and healing herbs,  And the olive and the palm,  And enclosed gardens thick with trees,  And fruits and herbage,  For the service of yourselves and of your cattle

 It had the privilege of asylum, but it was not lawful to inhabit it, or to carry on commerce within its limits, and its religious ceremonies were a bond of union to several of the Bedouin tribes of the Hejaz

By the witness and the witnessed!2  Cursed the masters of the trench3  Of the fuel-fed fire,  When they sat around it  Witnesses of what they inflicted on the believers!  Nor did they torment them but for their faith in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy:4  His the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth; and God is the witness of everything
  Verily, those who vexed the believers, men and women, and repented not, doth the torment of Hell, and the torment of the burning, await
  But for those who shall have believed and done the things that be right, are the Gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow
 This the immense bliss!  Verily, right terrible will be thy Lord's vengeance!  He it is who produceth all things, and causeth them to return;  And is He the Indulgent, the Loving;  Possessor of the Glorious throne;  Worker of that he willeth

  It needs not that I swear by the stars5 of retrograde motions  Which move swiftly and hide themselves away,  And by the night when it cometh darkening on,  And by the dawn when it brighteneth,  That this is the word of an illustrious Messenger,6  Endued with power, having influence with the Lord of the Throne,  Obeyed there by Angels, faithful to his trust,  And your compatriot is not one possessed by djinn;  For he saw him in the clear horizon:7  Nor doth he grapple with heaven's secrets,8  Nor doth he teach the doctrine of a cursed9 Satan
  Whither then are ye going?  Verily, this is no other than a warning to all creatures;  To him among you who willeth to walk in a straight path:  But will it ye shall not, unless as God willeth it,10 the Lord of the worlds

One day, the disturbing trumpet-blast shall disturb it,  Which the second blast shall follow:  Men's hearts on that day shall quake:-  Their looks be downcast
  The infidels will say, "Shall we indeed be restored as at first?  What! when we have become rotten bones?"  "This then," say they, "will be a return to loss
"  Verily, it will be but a single blast,  And lo! they are on the surface of the earth
  Hath the story of Moses reached thee?  When his Lord called to him in Towa's holy vale:  Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds:  And say, "Wouldest thou become just?  Then I will guide thee to thy Lord that thou mayest fear him
"  And he showed him a great miracle,-  But he treated him as an impostor, and rebelled;  Then turned he his back all hastily,  And gathered an assembly and proclaimed,  And said, "I am your Lord supreme
"  So God visited on him the punishment of this life and of the other
  Verily, herein is a lesson for him who hath the fear of God
  Are ye the harder to create, or the heaven which he hath built?  He reared its height and fashioned it,  And gave darkness to its night, and brought out its light,  And afterwards stretched forth the earth,-  He brought forth from it its waters and its pastures;  And set the mountains firm  For you and your cattle to enjoy
  But when the grand overthrow shall come,  The day when a man shall reflect on the pains that he hath taken,  And Hell shall be in full view of all who are looking on;  Then, as for him who hath transgressed  And hath chosen this present life,  Verily, Hell-that shall be his dwelling-place:  But as to him who shall have feared the majesty of his Lord, and shall have refrained his soul from lust,  Verily, Paradise-that shall be his dwelling-place
  They will ask thee of "the Hour," when will be its fixed time?  But what knowledge hast thou of it?  Its period is known only to thy Lord;  And thou art only charged with the warning of those who fear it
  On the day when they shall see it, it shall seem to them as though they had not tarried in the tomb, longer than its evening or its morn

  When the stars, therefore, shall be blotted out,  And when the heaven shall be cleft,  And when the mountains shall be scattered in dust,  And when the Apostles shall have a time assigned them;  Until what day shall that time be deferred?  To the day of severing!  And who shall teach thee what the day of severing is?  Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!  Have we not destroyed them of old?

Such is our power! and, how powerful are We!  Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!  Have we not made the earth to hold  The living and the dead?  And placed on it the tall firm mountains, and given you to drink of sweet water
  Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!  Begone to that Hell which ye called a lie:-  Begone to the shadows that lie in triple masses;  "But not against the flame shall they shade or help you:"-  The sparks which it casteth out are like towers-  Like tawny camels
  Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture!  On that day they shall not speak,  Nor shall it be permitted them to allege excuses

  If now ye have any craft try your craft on me

  Nay! they shall certainly knows its truth!  Again

  Have we not made the Earth a couch?  And the mountains its tent-stakes?  We have created you of two sexes,  And ordained your sleep for rest,  And ordained the night as a mantle,  And ordained the day for gaining livelihood,  And built above you seven solid2 heavens,  And placed therein a burning lamp;  And we send down water in abundance from the rain-clouds,  That we may bring forth by it corn and herbs,  And gardens thick with trees
  Lo! the day of Severance is fixed;  The day when there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and ye shall come in crowds,  And the heaven shall be opened and be full of portals,  And the mountains shall be set in motion, and melt into thin vapour
  Hell truly shall be a place of snares,  The home of transgressors,  To abide therein ages;  No coolness shall they taste therein nor any drink,  Save boiling water and running sores;  Meet recompense!  For they looked not forward to their account;  And they gave the lie to our signs, charging them with falsehood;  But we noted and wrote down all:  "Taste this then: and we will give you increase of nought but torment
"  But, for the God-fearing is a blissful abode,  Enclosed gardens and vineyards;  And damsels with swelling breasts, their peers in age,  And a full cup:  There shall they hear no vain discourse nor any falsehood:  A recompense from thy Lord-sufficing gift!-  Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that between3 them lieth-the God of Mercy! But not a word shall they obtain from Him
  On the day whereon the Spirit4 and the Angels shall be ranged in order, they shall not speak: save he whom the God of Mercy shall permit, and who shall say that which is right
  This is the sure day
 Whoso then will, let him take the path of return to his Lord

  Can they not look up to the clouds, how they are created;  And to the heaven how it is upraised;  And to the mountains how they are rooted;  And to the earth how it is outspread?  Warn thou then; for thou art a warner only:  Thou hast no authority over them:  But whoever shall turn back and disbelieve,  God shall punish him with the greater punishment

Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with Ad,  At Irem adorned with pillars,  Whose like have not been reared in these lands!  And with Themoud who hewed out the rocks in the valley;  And with Pharaoh the impaler;  Who all committed excesses in the lands,  And multiplied wickedness therein
  Wherefore thy Lord let loose on them the scourge of chastisement,2  For thy Lord standeth on a watch tower
  As to man, when his Lord trieth him and honoureth him and is bounteous to him,  Then saith he, "My Lord honoureth me:"  But when he proveth him and limiteth his gifts to him,  He saith, "My Lord despiseth me
"  Aye
 But ye honour not the orphan,  Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor,  And ye devour heritages, devouring greedily,  And ye love riches with exceeding love
  Aye
 But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing, crushing,  And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,  And Hell on that day shall be moved up,3-Man shall on that day remember himself
 But how shall remembrance help him?  He shall say, Oh! would that I had prepared for this my life! On that day none shall punish as God punisheth,  And none shall bind with such bonds as He
  Oh, thou soul which art at rest,  Return to thy Lord, pleased, and pleasing him:  Enter thou among my servants,  And enter thou my Paradise

  Thinketh man that we shall not re-unite his bones?  Aye! his very finger tips are we able evenly to replace
  But man chooseth to deny what is before him:  He asketh, "When this day of Resurrection?"  But when the eye shall be dazzled,  And when the moon shall be darkened,  And the sun and the moon shall be together,1  On that day man shall cry, "Where is there a place to flee to?"  But in vain-there is no refuge-  With thy Lord on that day shall be the sole asylum

)  Aye, but ye love the transitory,  And ye neglect the life to come
  On that day shall faces beam with light,  Outlooking towards their Lord;  And faces on that day shall be dismal,  As if they thought that some great calamity would befal them
  Aye, when the soul shall come up into the throat,  And there shall be a cry, "Who hath a charm that can restore him?"  And the man feeleth that the time of his departure is come,  And when one leg shall be laid over the other,4  To thy Lord on that day shall he be driven on;  For he believed not, and he did not pray,  But he called the truth a lie and turned his back,  Then, walking with haughty men, rejoined his people
  That Hour is nearer to thee and nearer,5  It is ever nearer to thee and nearer still

The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
  Yes! the register of the wicked is in Sidjin

  Woe, on that day, to those who treated our signs as lies,  Who treated the day of judgment as a lie!  None treat it as a lie, save the transgressor, the criminal,  Who, when our signs are rehearsed to him, saith, "Tales of the Ancients!"  Yes; but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts
  Yes; they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day;  Then shall they be burned in Hell-fire:  Then shall it be said to them, "This is what ye deemed a lie
"  Even so
 But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun
  And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is?  A book distinctly written;  The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it
  Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell!  Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around;  Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight;  Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff,  The seal of musk
 For this let those pant who pant for bliss-  Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim-2  Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink
  The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn:  And when they pass by them they wink at one another,-  And when they return to their own people, they return jesting,  And when they see them they say, "These are the erring ones
"  And yet they have no mission to be their guardians
  Therefore, on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn,  As reclining on bridal couches they behold them
  Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works?   _______________________  1 Sidjin is a prison in Hell which gives its name to the register of actions there kept, as Illiyoun, a name of the lofty apartments of Paradise, is transferred to the register of the righteous

  So as to Themoud,2 they were destroyed by crashing thunder bolts;  And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring and furious blast
  It did the bidding of God3 against them seven nights and eight days together, during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low, as though they had been the trunks of hollow palms;  And couldst thou have seen one of them surviving?  Pharaoh also, and those who flourished before him, and the overthrown cities, committed sin,-  And disobeyed the Sent one of their Lord; therefore did he chastise them with an accumulated chastisement
  When the Flood rose high, we bare you in the Ark,  That we might make that event a warning to you, and that the retaining ear might retain it
  But when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet,  And the earth and the mountains shall be upheaved, and shall both be crushed into dust at a single crushing,  On that day the woe that must come suddenly shall suddenly come,4  And the heaven shall cleave asunder, for on that day it shall be fragile;  And the angels shall be on its sides, and over them on that day eight shall bear up the throne of thy Lord
  On that day ye shall be brought before Him: none of your hidden deeds shall remain hidden:  And he who shall have his book given to him in his right hand, will say to his friends, "Take ye it; read ye my book;  I ever thought that to this my reckoning I should come
"  And his shall be a life that shall please him well,  In a lofty garden,  Whose clusters shall be near at hand:  "Eat ye and drink with healthy relish, as the meed of what ye sent on beforehand in the days which are past
"  But he who shall have his book given into his left hand, will say, "O that my book had never been given me!  And that I had never known my reckoning!  O that death had made an end of me!  My wealth hath not profited me!  My power hath perished from me!"  "Lay ye hold on him and chain him,  Then at the Hell-fire burn him,  Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him;  For he believed not in God, the Great,  And was not careful to feed the poor;  No friend therefore shall he have here this day,  Nor food, but corrupt sores,  Which none shall eat but the sinners
"  It needs not that I swear by what ye see,  And by that which ye see not,  That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour!  And that it is not the word of a poet-how little do ye believe!  Neither is it the word of a soothsayer (Kahin)-how little do ye receive warning!  It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds
  But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings,  We had surely seized him by the right hand,  And had cut through the vein of his neck
5  Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him
  But, verily, It (the Koran) is a warning for the God-fearing;  And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood
  But it shall be the despair of infidels,  For it is the very truth of sure knowledge
  Praise, then, the name of thy Lord, the Great

-THE SCATTERING [XLIII
]  MECCA
-60 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  By the clouds1 which scatter with SCATTERING,  And those which bear their load,  And by those which speed lightly along,  And those which apportion by command!  True, indeed, is that with which ye are threatened,  And lo! the judgment will surely come
2  By the star-tracked heaven!  Ye are discordant in what ye say;  But whose turneth him from the truth, is turned from it by a divine decree
  Perish the liars,  Who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance!  They ask, "When this day of judgment?"  On that day they shall be tormented at the fire
  "Taste ye of this your torment, whose speedy coming ye challenged
"  But the God-fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains,  Enjoying what their Lord hath given them, because, aforetime they were well- doers:  But little of the night was it that they slept,  And at dawn they prayed for pardon,  And gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast
  On Earth are signs for men of firm belief,  And also in your own selves: Will ye not then behold them?  The Heaven hath sustenance for you, and it containeth that which you are promised
  By the Lord then of the heaven and of the earth, I swear that this is the truth, even as ye speak yourselves
3  Hath the story reached thee of Abraham's honoured guests?4  When they went in unto him and said, "Peace!" he replied, "Peace:-they are strangers
"  And he went apart to his family, and brought a fatted calf,  And set it before them
 He said, "Eat ye not?"  And he conceived a fear of them
 They said to him, "Fear not;" and announced to him a wise son
  His wife came up with outcry: she smote her face and said, "What I, old and barren!"  They said, "Thus saith thy Lord
 He truly is the Wise, the Knowing
"  Said he, "And what, O messengers, is your errand?"  They said, "To a wicked people are we sent,  To hurl upon them stones of clay,  Destined5 by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses
"  And we brought forth the believers who were in the city:  But we found not in it but one family of Muslims
  And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement,-  And in Moses: when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power:  But relying on his forces6 he turned his back and said, "Sorcerer, or Possessed
"  So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea; for of all blame was he worthy
  And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating blast:  It touched not aught over which it came, but it turned it to dust
  And in Themoud:7 when it was said to them, "Enjoy yourselves for yet a while
"  But they rebelled against their Lord's command: so the tempest took them as they watched its coming
8  They were not able to stand upright, and could not help themselves
  And we destroyed the people of Noah, before them; for an impious people were they
  And the Heaven-with our hands have we built it up, and given it its expanse;  And the Earth-we have stretched it out like a carpet; and how  smoothly have we spread it forth!  And of everything have we created pairs: that haply ye may reflect
  Fly then to God: I come to you from him a plain warner
  And set not up another god with God: I come to you from him a plain warner
  Even thus came there no apostle to those who flourished before them, but they exclaimed, "Sorcerer, or Possessed
"  Have they made a legacy to one another of this scoff? Yes, they are a rebel people

  I have not created Djinn and men, but that they should worship me:  I require not sustenance from them, neither require I that they feed me:  Verily, God is the sole sustainer: possessed of might: the unshaken!

 Let them not challenge me to hasten it

  Reeling on that day the Heaven shall reel,  And stirring shall the mountains stir
2  And woe, on that day, to those who called the apostles liars,  Who plunged for pastime into vain disputes-  On that day shall they be thrust with thrusting to the fire of Hell:-  "This is the fire which ye treated as a lie
  What! is this magic, then? or, do ye not see it?  Burn ye therein: bear it patiently or impatiently 'twill be the same to you: for ye shall assuredly receive the reward of your doings
"  But mid gardens and delights shall they dwell who have feared God,  Rejoicing in what their Lord hath given them; and that from the pain of hell- fire hath their Lord preserved them
  "Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment, in recompense for your deeds
"  On couches ranged in rows shall they recline; and to the damsels with large dark eyes will we wed them
  And to those who have believed, whose offspring have followed them in the faith, will we again unite their offspring; nor of the meed of their works will we in the least defraud them
 Pledged to God is every man for his actions and their desert
3  And fruits in abundance will we give them, and flesh as they shall desire:  Therein shall they pass to one another the cup which shall engender no light discourse, no motive to sin:  And youths shall go round among them beautiful as imbedded pearls:  And shall accost one another and ask mutual questions
  "A time indeed there was," will they say, "when we were full of care as to the future lot of our families;  But kind hath God been to us, and from the pestilential torment hath he preserved us;  For, heretofore we called upon Him-and He is the Beneficent, the Merciful
"  Warn thou, then
 For thou by the favour of thy Lord art neither soothsayer nor possessed
  Will they say, "A poet! let us await some adverse turn of his fortune?"  SAY, wait ye, and in sooth I too will wait with you
  Is it their dreams which inspire them with this? or is it that they are a perverse people?  Will they say, "He hath forged it (the Koran) himself?" Nay, rather it is that they believed not
  Let them then produce a discourse like it, if they speak the Truth
  Were they created by nothing? or were they the creators of themselves?  Created they the Heavens and Earth? Nay, rather, they have no faith
  Hold they thy Lord's treasures? Bear they the rule supreme?  Have they a ladder for hearing the angels? Let any one who hath heard them bring a clear proof of it
  Hath God daughters and ye sons?  Asketh thou pay of them? they are themselves weighed down with debts
  Have they such a knowledge of the secret things that they can write them down?  Desire they to lay snares for thee? But the snared ones shall be they who do not believe
  Have they any God beside God? Glory be to God above what they join with Him
  And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down, they would say, "It is only a dense cloud
"  Leave them then until they come face to face with the day when they shall swoon away:  A day in which their snares shall not at all avail them, neither shall they be helped
  And verily, beside this is there a punishment for the evildoers: but most of them know it not
  Wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in our eye; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord when thou risest up,  And in the night-season: Praise him when the stars are setting

-THE INEVITABLE [XLV
]  MECCA
-96 Verses  In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  WHEN the day that must come shall have come suddenly,1  None shall treat that sudden coming as a lie:  Day that shall abase! Day that shall exalt!  When the earth shall be shaken with a shock,  And the mountains shall be crumbled with a crumbling,  And shall become scattered dust,  And into three bands shall ye be divided:2  Then the people of the right hand3-Oh! how happy shall be the people of the right hand!  And the people of the left hand-Oh! how wretched shall be the people of the left hand!  And they who were foremost on earth-the foremost still
4  These are they who shall be brought nigh to God,  In gardens of delight;  A crowd of the former  And few of the latter generations;  On inwrought couches  Reclining on them face to face:  Aye-blooming youths go round about to them  With goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine;  Their brows ache not from it, nor fails the sense:  And with such fruits as shall please them best,  And with flesh of such birds, as they shall long for:  And theirs shall be the Houris, with large dark eyes, like pearls  hidden in their shells,  In recompense of their labours past
  No vain discourse shall they hear therein, nor charge of sin,  But only the cry, "Peace! Peace!"  And the people of the right hand-oh! how happy shall be the people of the right hand!  Amid thornless sidrahs5  And talh6 trees clad with fruit,  And in extended shade,  And by flowing waters,  And with abundant fruits,7  Unfailing, unforbidden,  And on lofty couches
  Of a rare creation have we created the Houris,  And we have made them ever virgins,  Dear to their spouses, of equal age with them,8  For the people of the right hand,  A crowd of the former,  And a crowd of the latter generations
9  But the people of the left hand-oh! how wretched shall be the people of the left hand!  Amid pestilential10 winds and in scalding water,  And in the shadow of a black smoke,  Not cool, and horrid to behold
11  For they truly, ere this, were blessed with worldly goods,  But persisted in heinous sin,  And were wont to say,  "What! after we have died, and become dust and bones, shall we be raised?  And our fathers, the men of yore?"  SAY: Aye, the former and the latter:  Gathered shall they all be for the time of a known day
  Then ye, O ye the erring, the gainsaying,  Shall surely eat of the tree Ez-zakkoum,  And fill your bellies with it,  And thereupon shall ye drink boiling water,  And ye shall drink as the thirsty camel drinketh
  This shall be their repast in the day of reckoning!  We created you, will ye not credit us?12  What think ye? The germs of life13-  Is it ye who create them? or are we their creator?  It is we who have decreed that death should be among you;  Yet are we not thereby hindered14 from replacing you with others, your likes, or from producing you again in a form which ye know not!  Ye have known the first creation: will ye not then reflect?  What think ye? That which ye sow-  Is it ye who cause its upgrowth, or do we cause it to spring forth?  If we pleased we could so make your harvest dry and brittle that ye would ever marvel and say,  "Truly we have been at cost,15 yet are we forbidden harvest
"  What think ye of the water ye drink?  Is it ye who send it down from the clouds, or send we it down?  Brackish could we make it, if we pleased: will ye not then be thankful?  What think ye? The fire which ye obtain by friction-  Is it ye who rear its tree, or do we rear it?  It is we who have made it for a memorial and a benefit to the wayfarers of the desert,  Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great
  It needs not that I swear by the setting of the stars,  And it is a great oath, if ye knew it,  That this is the honourable Koran,  Written in the preserved Book:16  Let none touch it but the purified,17  It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
  Such tidings as these will ye disdain?  Will ye make it your daily bread to gainsay them?  Why, at the moment when the soul of a dying man shall come up into his throat,  And when ye are gazing at him,  Though we are nearer to him than ye, although ye see us not:-  Why do ye not, if ye are to escape the judgment,  Cause that soul to return? Tell me, if ye speak the truth
  But as to him who shall enjoy near access to God,  His shall be repose, and pleasure, and a garden of delights
  Yea, for him who shall be of the people of the right hand,  Shall be the greeting from the people of the right hand-"Peace be to thee
"  But for him who shall be of those who treat the prophets as deceivers,  And of the erring,  His entertainment shall be of scalding water,  And the broiling of hell-fire
  Verily this is a certain truth:  Praise therefore the name of thy Lord, the Great

 THE STAR [XLVI
]  MECCA
-62 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  By the STAR when it setteth,  Your compatriot erreth not, nor is he led astray,  Neither speaketh he from mere impulse
  The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him:  One terrible in power2 taught it him,  Endued with wisdom
 With even balance stood he  In the highest part of the horizon:  Then came he nearer and approached,  And was at the distance of two bows, or even closer,-  And he revealed to his servant what he revealed
  His heart falsified not what he saw
  What! will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw?  He had seen him also another time,  Near the Sidrah-tree, which marks the boundary
3  Near which is the garden of repose
  When the Sidrah-tree4 was covered with what covered it,5  His eye turned not aside, nor did it wander:  For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord
  Do you see Al-Lat and Al-Ozza,6  And Manat the third idol besides?7  What? shall ye have male progeny and God female?  This were indeed an unfair partition!  These are mere names: ye and your fathers named them thus: God hath not sent down any warranty in their regard
 A mere conceit and their own impulses do they follow
 Yet hath "the guidance" from their Lord come to them
  Shall man have whatever he wisheth?  The future and the present are in the hand of God:  And many as are the Angels in the Heavens, their intercession shall be of no avail8  Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept
  Verily, it is they who believe not in the life to come, who name the angels with names of females:  But herein they have no knowledge: they follow a mere conceit; and mere conceit can never take the place of truth
  Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth only this present life
  This is the sum of their knowledge
 Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who erreth from his way, and He best knoweth him who hath received guidance
  And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may reward those who do evil according to their deeds: and those who do good will He reward with good things
  To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter faults, verily, thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy
 He well knew you when he produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryos in your mother's womb
 Assert not then your own purity
 He best knoweth who feareth him
  Hast thou considered him who turned his back?  Who giveth little and is covetous?  Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things?  Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses?  And of Abraham faithful to his pledge?  That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another,  And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath made efforts:  And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light:  That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense,  And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things,  And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep,  And that He causeth to die and maketh alive,  And that He hath created the sexes, male and female,  From the diffused germs of life,9  And that with Him is the second creation,  And that He enricheth and causeth to possess,  And that He is the Lord of Sirius,10  And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites,  And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor,  And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most perverse
  And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown
  So that that which covered them covered them
  Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of doubt?11  He who warneth you is one of the warners of old
  The day that must draw nigh, draweth nigh already: and yet none but God can reveal its time
  Is it at these sayings that ye marvel?  And that ye laugh and weep not?  And that ye are triflers?  Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship
   _______________________  1 This Sura was revealed at about the time of the first emigration of Muhammad's followers to Abyssinia, A
 5
 The manner in which the Prophet cancelled the objectionable verses 19, 20, is the strongest proof of his sincerity (as also is the opening of Sura 1xxx
) at this period
 Had he not done so, nothing would have been easier for him than to have effected a reconciliation with the powerful party in Mecca, who had recently compelled his followers to emigrate
  2 The Angel Gabriel, to the meaning of whose name, as the strong one of God, these words probably allude
  3 That is, Beyond which neither men nor angels can pass (Djelal)
 The original word is also rendered, the Lote-Tree of the extremity, or of the loftiest spot in Paradise, in the seventh Heaven, on the right hand of the throne of God
 Its leaves are fabled to be as numerous as the members of the whole human family, and each leaf to bear the name of an individual
 This tree is shaken on the night of the 15th of Ramadan every year a little after sunset, when the leaves on which are inscribed the names of those who are to die in the ensuing year fall, either wholly withered, or with more or less green remaining, according to the months or weeks the person has yet to live
  4 The Sidrah is a prickly plum, which is called Ber in India, the zizyphus Jujuba of Linnæus
 A decoction of the leaves is used in India to wash the dead, on account of the sacredness of the tree
  5 Hosts of adoring angels, by which the tree was masked
  6 Al-Lat or El-Lat, probably the Alilat of Herodotus (iii
 8) was an idol at Nakhlah, a place east of the present site of Mecca
 Al-Ozza was an idol of the Kinanah tribe; but its hereditary priests were the Banu Solaym, who were stationed along the mercantile road to Syria in the neighbourhood of Chaibar
  7 When at the first recital of this Sura, the prophet had reached this verse, he continued,  These are the exalted females, [or, sublime swans, i
e
, mounting nearer and nearer to God]  And truly their intercession may be expected
  These words, however, which were received by the idolaters with great exultation, were disowned by Muhammad in the course of a few days as a Satanic suggestion, and replaced by the text as it now stands
 The probability is that the difficulties of his position led him to attempt a compromise of which he speedily repented
 In the Suras subsequent to this period the denunciations of idolatry become much sterner and clearer
 The authorities are given by Weil, Sprenger and Muir
 See Sura [lxvii
] xvii
 74- 76
  8 Verses 26-33 are probably later than the previous part of the Sura, but inserted with reference to it

2  Be thou patient therefore with becoming patience;  They forsooth regard that day as distant,  But we see it nigh:  The day when the heavens shall become as molten brass,  And the mountains shall become like flocks of wool:  And friend shall not question of friend,  Though they look at one another
 Fain would the wicked redeem himself from punishment on that day at the price of his children,  Of his spouse and his brother,  And of his kindred who shewed affection for him,  And of all who are on the earth that then it might deliver him
  But no
 For the fire,  Dragging by the scalp,  Shall claim him who turned his back and went away,  And amassed and hoarded
  Man truly is by creation hasty;  When evil befalleth him, impatient;  But when good falleth to his lot, tenacious
  Not so the prayerful,  Who are ever constant at their prayers;  And of whose substance there is a due and stated portion  For him who asketh, and for him who is ashamed3 to beg;  And who own the judgment-day a truth,  And who thrill with dread at the chastisement of their Lord-  For there is none safe from the chastisement of their Lord-  And who control their desires,  (Save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands have won, for there they shall be blameless;  But whoever indulge their desires beyond this are transgressors);  And who are true to their trusts and their engagements,  And who witness uprightly,  And who keep strictly the hours of prayer:  These shall dwell, laden with honours, amid gardens
  But what hath come to the unbelievers that they run at full stretch around thee,  On the right hand and on the left, in bands?  Is it that every man of them would fain enter that garden of delights?  Not at all
 We have created them, they know of what
  It needs not that I swear by the Lord of the East and of the West4 that we have power
  To replace them with better than themselves: neither are we to be hindered
  Wherefore let them flounder on and disport them, till they come face to face with their threatened day,  The day on which they shall flock up out of their graves in haste like men who rally to a standard:-  Their eyes downcast; disgrace shall cover them

-THE MOON [XLIX
]  MECCA
-55 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  The hour hath approached and the MOON hath been cleft:  But whenever they see a miracle they turn aside and say, This is well-devised magic
  And they have treated the prophets as impostors, and follow their own lusts; but everything is unalterably fixed
  A message of prohibition had come to them-  Consummate wisdom-but warners profit them not
  Quit them then
 On the day when the summoner shall summon to a stern business,  With downcast eyes shall they come forth from their graves, as if they were scattered locusts,  Hastening to the summoner
 "This," shall the infidels say, "is the distressful day
"  Before them the people of Noah treated the truth as a lie
 Our servant did they charge with falsehood, and said, "Demoniac!" and he was rejected
  Then cried he to his Lord, "Verily, they prevail against me; come thou therefore to my succour
"  So we opened the gates of Heaven with water which fell in torrents,  And we caused the earth to break forth with springs, and their waters met by settled decree
  And we bare him on a vessel made with planks and nails
  Under our eyes it floated on: a recompence to him who had been rejected with unbelief
  And we left it a sign: but, is there any one who receives the warning?  And how great was my vengeance and my menace!  Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there any one who receives the warning?  The Adites called the truth a lie: but how great was my vengeance and my menace;  For we sent against them a roaring wind in a day of continued distress:  It tore men away as though they were uprooted palm stumps
  And how great was my vengeance and my menace!  Easy for warning have we made the Koran-but, is there any one who receives the warning?  The tribe of Themoud treated the threatenings as lies:  And they said, "Shall we follow a single man from among ourselves? Then verily should we be in error and in folly
  To him alone among us is the office of warning entrusted? No! he is an impostor, an insolent person
"  To-morrow shall they learn who is the impostor, the insolent
  "For we will send the she-camel to prove them: do thou mark them well, O Saleh, and be patient:  And foretell them that their waters shall1 be divided between themselves and her, and that every draught shall come by turns to them
"  But they called to their comrade, and he took a knife and ham-strung her
  And how great was my vengeance and my menance!  We sent against them a single shout; and they became like the dry sticks of the fold-builders
  Easy have we made the Koran for warning-but, is there any one who receives the warning?  The people of Lot treated his warning as a lie;  But we sent a stone-charged wind against them all, except the family of Lot, whom at daybreak we delivered,  By our special grace-for thus we reward the thankful
  He, indeed, had warned them of our severity, but of that warning they doubted
  Even this guess did they demand: therefore we deprived them of sight,  And said, "Taste ye my vengeance and my menace;"  And in the morning a relentless punishment overtook them
  Easy have we made the Koran for warning but, is there any one who receives the warning?  To the people of Pharaoh also came the threatenings:  All our miracles did they treat as impostures
 Therefore seized we them as he only can seize, who is the Mighty, the Strong
  Are your infidels, O Meccans, better men than these? Is there an exemption for you in the sacred Books?  Will they say, "We are a host that lend one another aid?"  The host shall be routed, and they shall turn them back
  But, that Hour is their threatened time, and that Hour shall be most severe and bitter
  Verily, the wicked are sunk in bewilderment and folly
  On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces
 "Taste ye the touch of Hell
"  All things have we created after a fixed decree:  Our command was but one word, swift as the twinkling of an eye
  Of old, too, have we destroyed the like of you-yet is any one warned?  And everything that they do is in the Books;2  Each action, both small and great, is written down
  Verily, amid gardens3 and rivers shall the pious dwell
  In the seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King

-THE RANKS [L
]  MECCA
-182 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  By the angels ranged in order for Songs of Praise,  And by those who repel demons,1  And by those who recite the Koran for warning,  Truly your God is but one,  Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and Lord of the East
2  We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
  They serve also as a guard against every rebellious Satan,  That they overhear not what passeth in the assembly on high, for they are darted at from every side,3  Driven off and consigned to a lasting torment;  While, if one steal a word by stealth, a glistening flame pursueth him
  Ask the Meccans then, Are they, or the angels whom we have made, the stronger creation? Aye, of coarse clay have we created them
  But while thou marvellest they mock;  When they are warned, no warning do they take;  And when they see a sign, they fall to mocking,  And say, "This is no other than clear sorcery:  What! when dead, and turned to dust and bones, shall we indeed be raised?  Our sires also of olden times?"  Say, Yes; and ye shall be covered with disgrace
  For, one blast only, and lo! they shall gaze around them, And shall say, "Oh! woe to us! this is the day of reckoning; This is the day of decision which ye gainsaid as an untruth
"  Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their consorts,4 and the gods whom they adored  Beside God; and guide them to the road for Hell
  Set them forth: they shall be questioned
  "How now, that ye help not one another?"  But on this day they shall submit themselves to God,  And shall address one another with mutual reproaches
  They shall say, "In sooth, ye came to us in well-omened sort:"5  But they will answer, "Nay, it was ye who would not believe; and we had no power whatever over you
 Nay, ye were people given to transgress;  Just, therefore, is the doom which our Lord hath passed upon us
6 We shall surely taste it:  We made you err, for we had erred ourselves
"  Partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day
  Truly, thus will we deal with the wicked,  Because when it was said to them, There is no God but God, they swelled with pride,  And said, "Shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet?"  Nay, he cometh with truth and confirmeth the Sent Ones of old
  Ye shall surely taste the painful punishment,  And ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought,  Save the sincere servants of God!  A stated banquet shall they have  Of fruits; and honoured shall they be  In the gardens of delight,  Upon couches face to face
  A cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain,  Limpid, delicious to those who drink;  It shall not oppress the sense, nor shall they therewith be drunken
  And with them are the large-eyed ones with modest refraining glances, fair like the sheltered egg
7  And they shall address one another with mutual questions
  Saith one of them, "I truly had a bosom friend,  Who said, 'Art thou of those who credit it?  What! when we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be judged?"'  He shall say to those around him, "Will ye look?"  And he shall look and see him in the midst of Hell
  And he shall say to him, "By God, thou hadst almost caused me to perish;  And, but for the favour of my Lord, I had surely been of those who have been brought with thee into torment
"  "But do we not die," say the blessed,  "Any other than our first death? and have we escaped the torment?"8  This truly is the great felicity!  For the like of this should the travailers travail!  Is this the better repast or the tree Ez-zakkoum?  Verily, we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked
  It is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell;  Its fruits is as it were the heads of Satans;  And, lo! the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it:  Then shall they have, thereon, a mixture of boiling water:  Then shall they return to hell
  They found their fathers erring,  And they hastened on in their footsteps
  Also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred
  Though we had sent warners among them
  But see what was the end of these warned ones,  Except of God's true servants
  Noah called on us of old, and right prompt were we to hear him,9  And we saved him and his family out of the great distress,  And we made his offspring the survivors;  And we left for him with posterity,  "Peace be on Noah throughout the worlds!"  Thus do we reward the well-doers,  For he was one of our believing servants;-  And the rest we drowned
  And truly, of his faith was Abraham,  When he brought to his Lord a perfect heart,  When he said to his father and to his people, "What is this ye worship?  Prefer ye with falsehood gods to God?  And what deem ye of the Lord of the worlds?"  So gazing he gazed towards the stars,  And said, "In sooth I am ill:10  And they turned their back on him and departed
  He went aside to their gods and said, "Do ye not eat?  What aileth you that ye do not speak?"  He broke out upon them, with the right hand striking:  When his tribesmen came back to him with hasty steps  He said, "Worship ye what ye carve,  When God hath created you, and that ye make?"  They said, "Build up a pyre for him and cast him into the glowing flame
"  Fain would they plot against him, but we brought them low
  And he said, "Verily, I repair to my Lord who will guide me:  O Lord give me a son, of the righteous
"  We announced to him a youth of meekness
  And when he became a full-grown youth,11  His father said to him, "My son, I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice thee; therefore, consider what thou seest right
"  He said, "My father, do what thou art bidden; of the patient, if  God please, shalt thou find me
"  And when they had surrendered them to the will of God, he laid him down upon his forehead:  We cried unto him, "O Abraham!  Now hast thou satisfied the vision
" See how we recompense the righteous
  This was indeed a decisive test
  And we ransomed his son with a costly12 victim,  And we left this13 for him among posterity,  "PEACE BE ON ABRAHAM!"  Thus do we reward the well-doers,  For he was of our believing servants
  And we announced Isaac to him-a righteous Prophet-  And on him and on Isaac we bestowed our blessing
 And among their offspring were well-doers, and others, to their own hurt undoubted sinners
  And of old,14 to Moses and to Aaron shewed we favours:  And both of them, and their people, we rescued from the great distress:  And we succoured them, and they became the conquerors:  And we gave them (Moses and Aaron) each the lucid book:  And we guided them each into the right way:  And we left this for each among posterity,  "PEACE BE ON MOSES AND AARON
"  Thus do we reward the well-doers,  For they were two of our believing servants
  And Elias truly was of our Sent Ones,  When he said to his people, "Fear ye not God?  Invoke ye Baal and forsake ye the most skilful Creator?  God is your Lord, and the Lord of your sires of old?"  But they treated him as a liar, and shall therefore be consigned to punishment,  Except God's faithful servants
  And we left this for him among posterity,  "PEACE BE ON ELIASIN!"15  Thus do we reward the well-doers,  For he was one of our believing servants
  And Lot truly was of our Sent Ones,  When we rescued him and all his family,  Save an aged woman among those who tarried
  Afterward we destroyed the others
  And ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at morn  And night: will ye not then reflect?  Jonas, too, was one of the Apostles,  When he fled unto the laden ship,  And lots were cast,16 and he was doomed,  And the fish swallowed him, for he was blameworthy
  But had he not been of those who praise Us,  In its belly had he surely remained, till the day of resurrection
  And we cast him on the bare shore-and he was sick;-  And we caused a gourd-plant to grow up over him,  And we sent him to a hundred thousand persons, or even more,  And because they believed, we continued their enjoyments for a season
  Inquire then of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they, sons?  Have we created the angels females? and did they witness it?  Is it not a falsehood of their own devising, when they say,  "God hath begotten"? They are indeed liars
  Would he have preferred daughters to sons?  What reason have ye for thus judging?  Will ye not then receive this warning?  Have ye a clear proof for them?  Produce your Book if ye speak truth
  And they make him to be of kin with the Djinn: but the Djinn have long known that these idolaters shall be brought up before God
  Far be the glory of God from what they impute to him
  "His faithful servants do not thus
  Moreover, ye and what ye worship  Shall not stir up any against God,17  Save him who shall burn in Hell
  And verily each one of us hath his appointed place,  And we range ourselves in order,  And we celebrate His praises
"18  And if those infidels say,  "Had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old,19  We had surely been God's faithful servants
"  Yet they believe not the Koran
 But they shall know its truth at last
  Our word came of old to our servants the apostles,  That they should surely be the succoured,  And that our armies should procure the victory for them
  Turn aside therefore from them for a time,  And behold them, for they too shall in the end behold their doom
  Would they then hasten our vengeance?  But when it shall come down into their courts, an evil morning shall it be to those who have had their warning
  Turn aside from them therefore for a time
  And behold; for they too shall in the end behold their doom
  Far be the glory of thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute to him,  And peace be on his Apostles!  And praise be to God the Lord of the worlds

"  He said, "O my people! I come to you a plain-spoken warner:  Serve God and fear Him, and obey me:  Your sins will He forgive you, and respite you till the fixed Time; for when God's fixed Time hath come, it shall not be put back
 Would that ye knew this!"  He said, "Lord I have cried to my people night and day; and my cry doth but make them flee from me the more
  So oft as I cry to them, that thou mayest forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrap themselves in their garments, and persist in their error, and are disdainfully disdainful
  Then I cried aloud to them:  Then again spake I with plainness, and in private did I secretly address them:  And I said, Beg forgiveness of your Lord, for He is ready to forgive
  He will send down the very Heaven upon you in plenteous rains;  And will increase you in wealth and children; and will give you gardens, and will give you watercourses:-  What hath come to you that ye hope not for goodness from the hand of God?  For He it is who hath formed you by successive steps
1  See ye not how God hath created the seven heavens one over the other?  And He hath placed therein the moon as a light, and hath placed there the sun as a torch;  And God hath caused you to spring forth from the earth like a plant;  Hereafter will He turn you back into it again, and will bring you forth anew-  And God hath spread the earth for you like a carpet,  That ye may walk therein along spacious paths
"'  Said Noah, "O my Lord! they rebel against me, and they follow those whose riches and children do but aggravate their ruin
"  And they plotted a great plot;  And they said, "Forsake not your Gods; forsake not Wadd nor Sowah,  Nor Yaghuth and Yahuk and Nesr;"  And they caused many to err;2-and thou, too, O Muhammad! shalt be the means of increasing only error in the wicked-  Because of their sins they were drowned, and made to go into the Fire;  And they found that they had no helper save God
  And Noah said, "Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels on the Earth:  For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels
  O my Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and every one who, being a believer, shall enter my house, and believers men and women: and add to the wicked nought but perdition

  For the Infidels we have got ready chains and collars and flaming fire
  But a wine cup tempered at the camphor fountain2 the just shall quaff:  Fount whence the servants of God shall drink, and guide by channels from place to place;  They who fulfilled their vows, and feared the day whose woes will spread far and wide;  Who though longing for it themselves, bestowed their food on the poor and the orphan and the captive:  "We feed you for the sake of God: we seek from you neither recompense nor thanks:3  A stern and calamitous day dread we from our Lord
"  From the evil therefore of that day hath God delivered them and cast on them brightness of face and joy:  And hath rewarded their constancy, with Paradise and silken robes:  Reclining therein on bridal couches, nought shall they know of sun or piercing cold:  Its shades shall be close over them, and low shall its fruits hang down:  And vessels of silver and goblets like flagons shall be borne round among them:  Flagons of silver whose measure themselves shall mete
  And there shall they be given to drink of the cup tempered with zendjebil (ginger)  From the fount therein whose name is Selsebil (the softly flowing)
  Aye-blooming youths go round among them
 When thou lookest at them thou wouldest deem them scattered pearls;  And when thou seest this, thou wilt see delights and a vast kingdom:  Their clothing green silk robes and rich brocade: with silver bracelets shall they be adorned; and drink of a pure beverage shall their Lord give them
  This shall be your recompense
 Your efforts shall meet with thanks
  We ourselves have sent down to thee the Koran as a missive from on high
  Await then with patience the judgments of thy Lord, and obey not the wicked among them and the unbelieving:  And make mention of the name of thy Lord at morn, at even,  And at night
 Adore him, and praise him the livelong night
  But these men love the fleeting present, and leave behind them the heavy day of doom
  Ourselves have we created them, and strengthened their joints; and when we please, with others like unto themselves will we replace them
  This truly is a warning: And whoso willeth, taketh the way to his Lord;  But will it ye shall not, unless God will it, for God is Knowing, Wise
  He causeth whom He will to enter into his mercy
 But for the evil doers, He hath made ready an afflictive chastisement

1 By this clear Book!  See! on a blessed night2 have we sent it down, for we would warn mankind:  On the night wherein all things are disposed in wisdom,3  By virtue of our behest
 Lo! we have ever sent forth Apostles,  A mercy from thy Lord: he truly heareth and knoweth all things-  Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them,-if ye be firm in faith-  There is no God but He!-He maketh alive and killeth!-Your Lord and the Lord of your sires of old!  Yet with doubts do they disport them
  But mark them on the day when the Heaven shall give out a palpable SMOKE,  Which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive torment
  They will cry, "Our Lord! relieve us from this torment: see! we are believers
"  But how did warning avail them, when an undoubted apostle had come to them;  And they turned their backs on him, and said, "Taught by others, possessed?"  Were we to relieve you from the plague even a little, ye would certainly relapse
4  On the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness, we will surely take vengeance on them!  Of old, before their time, had we proved the people of Pharaoh, when a noble apostle presented himself to them
  "Send away with me," cried he, "the servants of God; for I am an apostle worthy of all credit:  And exalt not yourselves against God, for I come to you with undoubted power;  And I take refuge with Him who is my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone me not:  And if ye believe me not, at least separate yourselves from me
"  And he cried to his Lord, "That these are a wicked people
"  "March forth then, said God, with my servants by night, for ye will be pursued
  And leave behind you the cleft sea: they are a drowned host
"  How many a garden and fountain did they quit!  And corn fields and noble dwellings!  And pleasures in which they rejoiced them!  So was it: and we gave them as a heritage to another people
  Nor Heaven nor Earth wept for them, nor was their sentence respited;  And we rescued the children of Israel from a degrading affliction-  From Pharaoh, for he was haughty, given to excess
  And we chose them, in our prescience, above all peoples,5  And we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial
  Yet these infidels say,  "There is but our first death, neither shall we be raised again:  Bring back our sires, if ye be men of truth
"  Are they better than the people of Tobba,6  And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds?  We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is between them in sport:  We have not created them but for a serious end:7 but the greater part of them understand it not
  Verily the day of severing8 shall be the appointed time of all:  A day when the master shall not at all be aided by the servant, neither shall they be helped;  Save those on whom God shall have mercy: for He is the mighty, the merciful
  Verily the tree of Ez-Zakkoum9  Shall be the sinner's10 food:  Like dregs of oil shall it boil up in their bellies,  Like the boiling of scalding water
  "-Seize ye him, and drag him into the mid-fire;  Then pour on his head of the tormenting boiling water
  -'Taste this:' for thou forsooth art the mighty, the honourable!  Lo! this is that of which ye doubted
"  But the pious shall be in a secure place,  Amid gardens and fountains,  Clothed in silk and richest robes, facing one another:  Thus shall it be: and we will wed them to the virgins with large dark eyes:  Therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit;  Therein, their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and He shall keep them from the pains of Hell:-  'Tis the gracious bounty of thy Lord! This is the great felicity

 "This," say the infidels, "is a marvellous thing:  What! when dead and turned to dust shall we
 
 
 
? Far off is such a return as this?"  Now know we what the earth consumeth of them, and with us is a Book in which account is kept
  But they have treated the truth which hath come to them as falsehood; perplexed therefore is their state
  Will they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how we have reared it and decked it forth, and that there are no flaws therein?  And as to the earth, we have spread it out, and have thrown the mountains upon it, and have caused an upgrowth in it of all beauteous kinds of plants,  For insight and admonition to every servant who loveth to turn to God:  And we send down the rain from Heaven with its blessings, by which we cause gardens to spring forth and the grain of harvest,  And the tall palm trees with date-bearing branches one above the other  For man's nourishment: And life give we thereby to a dead country
 So also shall be the resurrection
  Ere the days of these (Meccans) the people of Noah, and the men of Rass2 and Themoud, treated their prophets as impostors:  And Ad and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot and the dwellers in the forest, and the people of Tobba,3 all gave the lie to their prophets: justly, therefore, were the menaces inflicted
  Are we wearied out with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard to a new creation!4  We created man: and we know what his soul whispereth to him, and we are closer to him than his neck-vein
  When the two angels charged with taking account shall take it, one sitting on the right hand, the other on the left:  Not a word doth he utter, but there is a watcher with him ready to note it down:  And the stupor of certain death cometh upon him: "This is what thou wouldst have shunned"-  And there shall be a blast on the trumpet,-it is the threatened day!  And every soul shall come,-an angel with it urging it along, and an angel to witness against it5-  Saith he, "Of this day didst thou live in heedlessness: but we have taken off thy veil from thee, and thy sight is becoming sharp this day
"  And he who is at this side6 shall say, "This is what I am prepared with against thee
"  And God will say, "Cast into Hell, ye twain, every infidel, every hardened one,  The hinderer of the good, the transgressor, the doubter,  Who set up other gods with God
 Cast ye him into the fierce torment
"  He who is at his side shall say, "O our Lord! I led him not astray, yet was he in an error wide of truth
"  He shall say, "Wrangle not in my presence
 I had plied you beforehand with menaces:  My doom changeth not, and I am not unjust to man
"  On that day will we cry to Hell, "Art thou full?" And it shall say, "Are there more?"7  And not far from thence shall Paradise be brought near unto the Pious:  - "This is what ye have been promised: to every one who hath turned in penitence to God and kept his laws;  Who hath feared the God of Mercy in secret, and come to him with a contrite heart:  Enter it in peace: this is the day of Eternity
"  There shall they have all that they can desire: and our's will it be to augment their bliss:  And how many generations have we destroyed ere the days of these (Meccans), mightier than they in strength! Search ye then the land
 Is there any escape?  Lo! herein is warning for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear, and is himself an eye-witness
8  We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and no weariness touched us
9  Wherefore put up with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before sunrise and before sunset:  And praise Him in the night: and perform the two final prostrations
  And list for the day whereon the crier shall cry from a place near to every one alike:  The day on which men shall in truth hear that shout will be the day of their coming forth from the grave
  Verily, we cause to live, and we cause to die
 To us shall all return
  On the day when the earth shall swiftly cleave asunder over the dead, will this gathering be easy to Us
  We know best what the infidels say: and thou art not to compel them
  Warn then by the Koran those who fear my menace

2 Not to sadden thee have we sent down this Koran to thee,  But as a warning for him who feareth;  It is a missive from Him who hath made the earth and the lofty heavens!  The God of Mercy sitteth on his throne:  His, whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them both, and whatsoever is beneath the humid soil!  Thou needest not raise thy voice:3 for He knoweth the secret whisper, and the yet more hidden
  God! There is no God but He! Most excellent His titles!  Hath the history of Moses reached thee?  When he saw a fire, and said to his family, "Tarry ye here, for I perceive a fire:  Haply I may bring you a brand from it, or find at the fire a guide
"4  And when he came to it, he was called to, "O Moses!  Verily, I am thy Lord:
 therefore pull off thy shoes: for thou art in the holy valley of Towa
  And I have chosen thee: hearken then to what shall be revealed
  Verily, I am God: there is no God but me: therefore worship me, and observe prayer for a remembrance of me
  Verily the hour is coming:-I all but manifest it-  That every soul may be recompensed for its labours
  Nor let him who believeth not therein and followeth his lust, turn thee aside from this truth, and thou perish
  Now, what is that in thy right hand, O Moses?"  Said he, "It is my staff on which I lean, and with which I beast down leaves for my sheep, and I have other uses for it
"  He said, "Cast it down, O Moses!"  So he cast it down, and lo! it became a serpent that ran along
  He said, "Lay hold on it, and fear not: to its former state will we restore it
"  "Now place thy right hand to thy arm-pit: it shall come forth white, but unhurt:-another sign!-  That We may shew thee the greatest of our signs
  Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds
"  He said, "O my Lord! enlarge my breast for me,  And make my work easy for me,  And loose the knot of my tongue,5  That they may understand my speech
  And give me a counsellor6 from among my family,  Aaron my brother;  By him gird up my loins,7  And make him a colleague in my work,  That we may praise thee oft and oft remember thee,  For thou regardest us
"  He said, "O Moses, thou hast obtained thy suit:  Already, at another time, have we showed thee favour,  When we spake unto thy mother what was spoken:  'Cast him into the ark:8 then cast him on the sea [the river], and the sea shall throw him on the shore: and an enemy to me and an enemy to him shall take him up
' And I myself have made thee an object of love,  That thou mightest be reared in mine eye
  When thy sister went and said, 'Shall I shew you one who will nurse him?'9 Then We returned thee to thy mother that her eye might be cheered, and that she might not grieve
 And when thou slewest a person, We delivered thee from trouble, and We tried thee with other trial
  For years didst thou stay among the people of Midian; then camest thou hither by my decree, O Moses:  And I have chosen thee for Myself
  Go thou and thy brother with my signs and be not slack to remember me
  Go ye to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds:  But speak ye to him with gentle speech; haply he will reflect or fear
"  They said, "O our Lord! truly we fear lest he break forth against us, or act with exceeding injustice
"  He said, "Fear ye not, for I am with you both
 I will hearken and I will behold
  Go ye then to him and say, 'Verily we are Sent ones of thy Lord; send therefore the children of Israel with us and vex them not: now are we come to thee with signs from thy Lord, and, Peace shall be on him who followeth the right guidance
  For now hath it been revealed to us, that chastisement shall be on him who chargeth with falsehood, and turneth him away
"'  And he said, "Who is your Lord, O Moses?"  He said, "Our Lord is He who hath given to everything its form and then guideth it aright
"  "But what," said he, "was the state of generations past?"10  He said, "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in the Book of his decrees
 My Lord erreth not, nor forgetteth
  He hath spread the earth as a bed, and hath traced out paths for you therein, and hath sent down rain from Heaven, and by it we bring forth the kinds11 of various herbs:  -'Eat ye, and feed your cattle
' Of a truth in this are signs unto men endued with understanding
  From it have we created you, and into it will we return you, and out of it will we bring you forth a second time
"12  And we shewed him all our signs: but he treated them as falsehoods, and refused to believe
  He said, "Hast thou come, O Moses, to drive us from our land by thine enchantments?  Therefore will we assuredly confront thee with like enchantments: so appoint a meeting between us and you-we will not fail it, we, and do not thou-in a place alike for both
"  He said, "On the feast day13 be your meeting, and in broad daylight let the people be assembled
"  And Pharaoh turned away, and collected his craftsmen and came
  Said Moses to them, "Woe to you! devise not a lie against God:  For then will he destroy you by a punishment
 They who have lied have ever perished
"  And the magicians discussed their plan, and spake apart in secret:  They said, "These two are surely sorcerers: fain would they drive you from your land by their sorceries, and lead away in their paths your chiefest men:  So muster your craft: then come in order: well this day shall it be for him, who shall gain the upper hand
"  They said, "O Moses, wilt thou first cast down thy rod, or shall we be the first who cast?"  He said, "Yes, cast ye down first
" And lo! by their enchantment their cords and rods seemed to him as if they ran
  And Moses conceived a secret fear within him
  We said, "Fear not, for thou shalt be the uppermost:  Cast forth then what is in thy right hand: it shall swallow up what they have produced: they have only produced the deceit of an enchanter: and come where he may, ill shall an enchanter fare
"  And the magicians fell down and worshipped
 They said,  "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses
"  Said Pharaoh, "Believe ye on him ere I give you leave? He, in sooth, is your Master who hath taught you magic
 I will therefore cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on trunks of the palm, and assuredly shall ye learn which of us is severest in punishing, and who is the more abiding
"14  They said, "We will not have more regard to thee than to the clear tokens which have come to us, or than to Him who hath made us: doom the doom thou wilt: Thou canst only doom as to this present life: of a truth we have believed on our Lord that he may pardon us our sins and the sorcery to which thou hast forced us, for God is better, and more abiding than thou
15  As for him who shall come before his Lord laden with crime-for him verily is Hell: he shall not die in it and he shall not live
  But he who shall come before Him, a believer, with righteous works,-these! the loftiest grades await them:  Gardens of Eden, beneath whose trees16 the rivers flow: therein shall they abide for ever
 This, the reward of him who hath been pure
"  Then revealed we to Moses, "Go forth by night with my servants and cleave for them a dry path in the sea;  Fear not thou to be overtaken, neither be thou afraid
"  And Pharaoh followed them with his hosts, and the whelming billows of the sea overwhelmed them,17 for Pharaoh misled his people, and did not guide them
  O children of Israel! we rescued you from your foes; and We appointed a meeting with you on the right side of the mountain; and We caused the manna and the quail to descend upon you:  "Eat," said We, "of the good things with which we have supplied you; but without excess, lest my wrath fall upon you; for on whom my wrath doth fall, he perisheth outright
  Surely however will I forgive him who turneth to God and believeth, and worketh righteousness, and then yieldeth to guidance
  But what hath hastened thee on apart from thy people,18 O Moses?"  He said, "They are hard on my footsteps: but to thee, O Lord, have I hastened, that thou mightest be well pleased with me
"  He said, "Of a truth now have we proved thy people since thou didst leave them, and Samiri19 had led them astray
"  And Moses returned to his people, angered, sorrowful
  He said, "O my people! did not your Lord promise you a good promise? Was the time of my absence long to you? or desired ye that wrath from your Lord should light upon you, that ye failed in your promise to me?"  They said, "Not of our own accord have we failed in the promise to thee, but we were made to bring loads of the people's trinkets, and we threw them into the fire and Samiri likewise cast them in, and brought forth to them a corporeal lowing20 calf: and they said, "This is your God and the God of Moses, whom he hath forgotten
"'  What! saw they not that it returned them no answer, and could neither hurt nor help them?  And Aaron had before said to them, "O my people! by this calf are ye only proved: surely your Lord is the God of Mercy: follow me therefore and obey my bidding
"  They said, "We will not cease devotion to it, till Moses come back to us
"  He said, "O Aaron! when thou sawest that they had gone astray, what hindered thee from following me? Hast thou then disobeyed my command?"  He said, "O Son of my mother! seize me not by my beard, nor by my head: indeed I feared lest thou shouldst say,  Thou hast rent the children of Isreal asunder, and hast not observed my orders
"'  He said, "And what was thy motive, O Samiri?" He said, "I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful of dust from the track21 of the messenger of God, and flung it into the calf, for so my soul prompted me
"  He said, "Begone then: verily thy doom even in this life shall be to say, 'Touch me not
'22 And there is a threat against thee, which thou shalt not escape hereafter
 Now look at thy god to which thou hast continued so devoted: we will surely burn it and reduce it to ashes, which we will cast into the sea
  Your God is God, beside whom there is no God: In his knowledge he embraceth all things
"  Thus do We recite to thee histories of what passed of old; and from ourself have we given thee admonition
  Whoso shall turn aside from it shall verily carry a burden on the day of Resurrection:  Under it shall they remain: and grievous, in the day of Resurrection, shall it be to them to bear
  On that day there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and We will gather the wicked together on that day with leaden23 eyes:  They shall say in a low voice, one to another,-"Ye tarried but ten days on earth
"  We are most knowing with respect to that which they will say when the most veracious24 of them will say
 "Ye have not tarried above a day
"  And they will ask thee of the mountains: SAY: scattering my Lord will scatter them in dust;  And he will leave them a level plain: thou shalt see in it no hollows or jutting hills
  On that day shall men follow their summoner25-he marcheth straight on: and low shall be their voices before the God of Mercy, nor shalt thou hear aught but the light footfall
  No intercession shall avail on that day, save his whom the God of Mercy shall allow to intercede, and whose words he shall approve
  He knoweth their future and their past; but in their own knowledge they comprehend it not:-  And humble shall be their faces before Him that Liveth, the Self-subsisting: and undone he, who shall bear the burden of iniquity;  But he who shall have done the things that are right and is a believer, shall fear neither wrong nor loss
  Thus have We sent down to thee an Arabic Koran, and have set forth menaces therein diversely, that haply they may fear God, or that it may give birth to reflection in them
  Exalted then be God, the King, the Truth! Be not hasty in its recital26 while the revelation of it to thee is incomplete
 Say rather, "O my Lord, increase knowledge unto me
"  And of old We made a covenant with Adam; but he forgat it; and we found no firmness of purpose in him
  And when We said to the angels, "Fall down and worship Adam," they worshipped all, save Eblis, who refused: and We said, "O Adam! this truly is a foe to thee and to thy wife
 Let him not therefore drive you out of the garden, and ye become wretched;  For to thee is it granted that thou shalt not hunger therein, neither shalt thou be naked;  But Satan whispered him: said he, "O Adam! shall I shew thee the tree of Eternity,27 and the Kingdom that faileth not?"  And they both ate thereof, and their nakedness appeared to them, and they began to sew of the leaves of the Garden to cover them, and Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray
  Afterwards his Lord chose him for himself, and was turned towards him, and guided him
  And God said, "Get ye all down hence, the one of you a foe unto the other
 Hereafter shall guidance come unto you from me;  And whoso followeth my guidance shall not err, and shall not be wretched:  But whoso turneth away from my monition, his truly shall be a life of misery:  And We will assemble him with others on the day of Resurrection, blind
"28  He will say, "O my Lord! why hast thou assembled me with others, blind? whereas I was endowed with sight
"  He will answer, "Thus is it, because our signs came unto thee and thou didst forget them, and thus shalt thou be forgotten this day
"  Even thus will We recompense him who hath transgressed and hath not believed in the signs of his Lord; and assuredly the chastisement of the next world will be more severe and more lasting
  Are not they, who walk the very places where they dwelt, aware how many generations we have destroyed before them? Verily in this are signs to men of insight
  And had not a decree of respite from thy Lord first gone forth, their chastisement had at once ensued
 Yet the time is fixed
  Put up then with what they say; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before the sunrise, and before its setting; and some time in the night do thou praise him, and in the extremes29 of the day, that thou haply mayest please Him
  And strain not thine eye after what We have bestowed on divers of them-the braveries of this world-that we may thereby prove them
 The portion which thy Lord will give, is better and more lasting
  Enjoin prayer on thy family, and persevere therein
 We ask not of thee to find thine own provision-we will provide for thee, and a happy issue shall there be to piety
  But they say, "If he come not to us with a sign from his Lord 
 
 
!"30 But have not clear proofs for the Koran come to them, in what is in the Books of old?  And had We destroyed them by a chastisement before its time, they would surely have said, "O our Lord! How could we believe if thou didst not send unto us an Apostle that we might follow thy signs ere that we were humbled and disgraced
"  SAY: Each one of us awaiteth the end
 Wait ye then, and ye shall know which of us have been followers of the even way, and who hath been the rightly guided

2 These are the signs of the lucid Book
  Haply thou wearest thyself away with grief because they will not believe
  Were it our will we could send down to them a sign from Heaven, before which they would humbly bow
3  But from each fresh warning that cometh to them from the God of Mercy they have only turned aside,  And treated it as a lie: But tidings shall reach them which they shall not laugh to scorn
  Have they not beheld the earth-how we have caused every kind of noble plant to spring up therein?  Verily, in this is a sign: but most of them believe not
  And assuredly, thy Lord!-He is the Mighty, the Merciful
  And remember when thy Lord called to Moses, "Go to the wicked people,  The people of Pharaoh
 What! will they not fear me?"  He said, "My Lord, in sooth I fear lest they treat me as a liar:  And my breast is straitened, and I am slow of speech:4 send therefore to Aaron to be my helpmate
  For they have a charge5 against me, and I fear lest they put me to death
"  He said, "Surely not
 Go ye therefore with our signs: we will be with you and will hearken
  And go to Pharaoh and say: 'Verily we are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds-  Send forth with us the children of Israel
"'  He said, "Did we not rear thee among us when a child? And hast thou not passed years of thy life among us?  And yet what a deed is that which thou hast done!6 Thou art one of the ungrateful
"  He said, "I did it indeed, and I was one of those who erred: And I fled from you because I feared you; but my Lord hath given me wisdom and hath made me one of his Apostles
  And is this the favour thou hast conferred on me, that thou hast enslaved the children of Israel?"  Said Pharaoh, "Who then is the Lord of the Worlds?"  He said, "The Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them, if only ye believe it
"  Said Pharaoh to those around him, "Hear ye this?"  "Your Lord," said Moses, "and the Lord of your sires of old
"  "In sooth, your Apostle whom He hath sent to you," said Pharaoh, "is certainly possessed
"  He said, "Lord is He of the East and of the West, and of all that is between them, if ye can understand
"  He said, "If ye take any God beside me, I will surely put thee in ward
"  Said Moses, "What! if I shew thee that which shall be a proof of my mission?"  He said, "Forth with it then, if thou speakest truth
"  Then threw he down his staff, and lo! an undoubted serpent:  And he drew out his hand, and lo! it was white7 to the beholders
  He said to his nobles around him
 "This truly is a right cunning sorcerer:  Fain would he drive you out of your land by his Sorcery
 But what do ye suggest?"  They said, "Put him and his brother off awhile, and send summoners to all the cities,  Who shall bring to thee every cunning magician
"  So the magicians were mustered at a set time, on a solemn day:  And it was said to the people, "Are ye all assembled?"  -"Yes! and we will follow the magicians if they gain the day
"  And when the magicians were arrived they said to Pharaoh, "Shall we have a reward if we gain the day?"  He said, "Yes
 And verily in that case ye shall be of those who are near my person
"  Moses said to them, "Throw down what ye have to throw
"  So they cast down their ropes and rods, and said, "By Pharaoh's might we shall surely win
"  Then Moses threw down his rod, and lo! it swallowed up their cheating wonders
  Then the magicians threw themselves down in worship:  They said, "We believe on the Lord of the Worlds,  The Lord of Moses and of Aaron
"  Said Pharaoh, "Have ye then believed on him ere I gave you leave? He truly is your master who hath taught you magic
8 But bye and bye ye shall surely know my power
  I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you all crucified
"  They said, "It cannot harm us, for to our Lord shall we return:  Assuredly we trust that our Lord will forgive us our sins, since we are of the first who believe
"  Then revealed we this order to Moses: "Go forth by night with my servants, for ye will be pursued
"  And Pharaoh sent summoners through the cities:-  "These Israelites," said they, "are a scanty band;  Yet are they enraged against us-  But we truly are numerous, wary
"  Thus we caused them to quit gardens and fountains,  And treasures and splendid dwellings;  So was it; and we gave them to the children of Israel for an heritage
9  Then at sunrise the Egyptians followed them:  And when the hosts came in view of one another, the comrades of Moses said, "We are surely overtaken
"  He said, "By no means:-for my Lord is with me-He will guide me
"  And we revealed this order to Moses, "Strike the sea with thy rod
" And it clave asunder, and each part became like a huge mountain
  Then made we the others to draw on;  And we saved Moses, and those who were with him, all;  But we drowned the others
  Truly in this was a sign; but most of them did not believe
  But verily thy Lord,-He is the Mighty, the Merciful!  And recite to them the story of Abraham  When he said to his Father and to his people, "What worship ye?"  They said, "We worship idols, and constant is our devotion to them
"  He said, "Can they hear you when ye cry to them?  Or help you or do you harm?"  They said, "But we found our Fathers do the like
"  He said, "How think ye? They whom ye worship,  Ye and your fathers of early days,  Are my foes: but not so10 the Lord of the Worlds,  Who hath created me, and guideth me,  Who giveth me food and drink;  And when I am sick, he healeth me,  And who will cause me to die and again quicken me,  And who, I hope, will forgive me my sins in the day of reckoning
  My Lord! bestow on me wisdom and join me to the just,  And give me a good name11 among posterity,  And make me one of the heirs of the garden of delight,  And forgive my father, for he was one of the erring,  And put me not to shame on the day when mankind shall be raised up,  The day when neither wealth nor children shall avail,  Save to him who shall come to God with a sound heart:  When Paradise shall be brought near the pious,  And Hell shall lay open for those who have gone astray
  And it shall be said to them, 'Where are they whom ye worshipped  Beside God? Can they harm you or help themselves?'  And they shall be cast into it-the seducers and the seduced,  And all the host of Eblis
  They shall say, as they wrangle therein together,  'By God, we were in a plain error,  When we equalled you with the Lord of the Worlds:  And none misled us but the wicked,  And we have none to plead for us,  Nor friend who careth for us
  Could we but return, we would be of the believers
"'  Verily, in this was a sign: but most of them believed not
  And truly thy Lord!-He is the Mighty, the Merciful!  The people of Noah gainsaid the Apostles,  When their brother Noah said to them, "Will ye not fear God?  Of a truth am I your faithful Apostle;  Fear God then and obey me
  I ask of you no reward for this, for my reward is of the Lord of the Worlds alone:  Fear God then and obey me
"  They said, "Shall we believe on thee when the meanest only are thy followers?"  He said, "But I have no knowledge of that they did:12  To my Lord only must their account be given: would that ye understood this!  And I will not thrust away those who believe,  For I am only one charged with plain warnings
"  They said, "Now unless thou desist, O Noah, one of the stoned shalt thou surely be
"  He said, "Lord! my people treat me as a liar:  Decide thou therefore a decision between me and them, and rescue me and the faithful who are with me
"  So we saved him and those who were with him in the fully-laden ark,  And afterwards we drowned the rest
  Herein truly was a sign, but most of them believed not
  But thy Lord!-He is the Mighty, the Merciful
  The Adites13 treated their Apostles as liars,  When their brother Houd said to them, "Will ye not fear God?  I am your Apostle, worthy of all credit;  Fear God then and obey me:  I ask for no reward for this; for my reward is of the Lord of the Worlds alone
  What! build ye landmarks on all heights in mere pastime?  And raise ye structures to be your lasting abodes?14  And when ye put forth your power do ye put it forth with harshness?  Fear ye God then and obey me;  And fear ye Him who hath plenteously betowed on you ye well know what:  Plenteously bestowed on you flocks and children,  And gardens and fountains;  Indeed I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day
"  They said, "It is the same to us whether thou warn or warn us not
  This is but a tale of the ancients,  And we are not they who shall be punished
"  And they charged him with imposture; and we destroyed them
 In this was a sign: but most of them believed not
  But thy Lord!-He is the Mighty, the Merciful!  The Themoudites also treated their Apostles as liars,  When their brother Saleh said to them, "Will ye not fear God?  I am your Apostle worthy of all credit:  Fear God, then, and obey me
  I ask of you no reward for this: my reward is of the Lord of the Worlds alone
  Shall ye be left secure amid these things here?  Amid gardens and fountains,  And corn-fields and palm-trees, with flower-sheathing branches?  And, insolent that ye are, will ye hew out your dwellings in the mountains?  But fear God and obey me,  And obey not the bidding of those who commit excess,  Who act disorderly on the earth and reform it not
"  They said, "Certainly thou art a person bewitched;  Thou art only a man like us: produce now a sign if thou art a man of truth
"  He said, "This she-camel, then-drink shall there be for her, and drink shall there be for you, on a several day for each
  But harm her not, lest the punishment of a tremendous day overtake you
"  But they ham-strung her, and repented of it on the morrow;  For the punishment overtook them
 In this truly was a sign, but most of them believed not
  But thy Lord!-He is the Powerful, the Merciful!  The people of Lot treated their apostles as liars,  When their brother Lot said to them, "Will ye not fear God?  I am your Apostle worthy of all credit:  Fear God, then, and obey me
  For this I ask you no reward: my reward is of the Lord of the worlds alone
  What! with men, of all creatures, will ye have commerce?  And leave ye your wives whom your Lord hath created for you? Ah! ye are an erring people!"  They said, "O Lot, if thou desist not, one of the banished shalt thou surely be
"  He said, "I utterly abhor your doings:  My Lord! deliver me and my family from what they do
"  So we delivered him and his whole family-  Save an aged one among those who tarried-  Then we destroyed the rest-  And we rained a rain upon them, and fatal was the rain to those whom we had warned
  In this truly was a sign; but most of them did not believe
  But thy Lord! He is the Powerful, the Merciful!  The dwellers in the forest of Madian15 treated the Apostles as liars
  When Shoaib their brother said to them, "Will ye not fear God?  I truly am your trustworthy Apostle
  Fear God, then, and obey me:  No reward ask I of you for this: my reward is of the Lord of the Worlds alone
  Fill the measure, and be not of those who minish:  Weigh with exact balance:  And defraud not men in their substance, and do no wrong on the earth by deeds of licence;  And fear Him who made you and the races of old
"  They said, "Certainly thou art a person bewitched
  Thou art but a man like us, and we deem thee liar-  Make now a part of the heaven to fall down upon us, if thou art a man of truth
"  He said, "My Lord best knoweth your doings
"  And when they treated him as a liar, the chastisement of the day of cloud overtook them
 This truly was the chastisement of a dreadful day!  In this was a sign, but most of them believed not
  But thy Lord!-He is the Mighty, the Merciful!  Verily from the Lord of the Worlds hath this Book come down;  The faithful spirit16 hath come down with it  Upon thy heart, that thou mightest become a warner-  In the clear Arabic tongue:  And truly it is foretold in the Scriptures of them of yore
17  Was it not a sign to them18 that the learned among the children of Israel recognised it?  If we had sent it down unto any foreigner,  And he had recited it to them, they had not believed
  In such sort have we influenced19 the heart of the wicked ones,  That they will not believe it till they see the grievous chastisement?  And it shall come upon them on a sudden when they look not for it:  And they will say, "Can we be respited?"  What! will they seek to hasten on our chastisement?  How thinkest thou? If after we have given them their fill for years,  That with which they are menaced come upon them at last,  Of what avail will their enjoyments be to them?  We never destroyed a city which had not first its warners  With admonition; nor did we deal unjustly
  The Satans were not sent down with this Koran:  It beseemed them not, and they had not the power,  For they are far removed from hearing it
20  Call not thou on any other god but God, lest thou be of those consigned to torment:  But warn thy relatives of nearer kin,21  And kindly lower thy wing over the faithful who follow thee
  And if they disobey thee, then say: "I will not be answerable for your doings;"-  And put thy trust in Him that is the Mighty, the Merciful,  Who seeth thee when thou standest in prayer,  And thy demeanour amongst those who worship;  For He heareth, knoweth all
  Shall I tell you on whom Satan descend?  They descend on every lying, wicked person:  They impart what they have heard;22-but most of them are liars
  It is the POETS23 whom the erring follow:  Seest thou not how they rove distraught in every valley?  And that they say that which they do not?  Save those who believe and do good works, and oft remember God;  And who defend themselves when unjustly treated
 But they who treat them unjustly shall find out what a lot awaiteth them

  21 It is probable that within three or four years from his entry upon the prophetic office, Muhammad had made about 40 converts
 Some biographers refer to this passage, and not to Sura lxiv
 I, as the first call to preach
 But this Sura is itself late, and bears evidence of the opposition to which the prophet had become exposed, and of adherents to his cause, now become numerous
 The diffuseness and feeblenss of the style clearly point to a late origin
  22 They impart to their votaries on earth what they have learned by stealth and partially, in heaven
  23 Muhammad found it necessary to employ the pens of certain poets to defend himself and his religion from the ridicule and satire of other poets, whose productions were recited at the great annual fair held at Okatz, the Olympus of the Hejaz
 The poems which were judged the best were written up in letters of gold, or suspended (hence called Moallakat) in the Caaba
 These poetical contests were subsequently suppressed by Muhammad, as offering openings for discussions which might prove inconvenient, and dangerous to his rising claims

2 These are the signs of the Book, and of a lucid recital [Koran]
  Many a time will the infidels wish that they had been Muslims
  Let them feast and enjoy themselves, and let hope beguile them: but they shall know the truth at last
  We never destroyed a city whose term was not perfixed:3  No people can forestall or retard its destiny
  They say: "O thou to whom the warning hath been sent down, thou art surely possessed by a djinn:  Wouldst thou not have come to us with the angels, if thou wert of those who assert the truth?"  -We will not send down the angels without due cause
4 The Infidels would not in that case have been respited
  Verily, We have sent down the warning, and verily, We will be its guardian;  And already have We sent Apostles, before thee, among the sects of the ancients;  But never came Apostles to them whom they did not deride
  In like manner will We put it into the hearts of the sinners of Mecca to do the same:  They will not believe on him though the example of those of old hath gone before
  Even were We to open above them a gate in Heaven, yet all the while they were mounting up to it,  They would surely say: It is only that our eyes are drunken: nay, we are a people enchanted
  We have set the signs of the zodiac5 in the Heavens, and adorned and decked them forth for the beholders,  And We guard them from every stoned6 Satan,  Save such as steal a hearing:7 and him doth a visible flame pursue
  And the Earth have We spread forth, and thrown thereon the mountains, and caused everything to spring forth in it in balanced measure:  And We have provided therein sustenance for you, and for the creatures which not ye sustain:  And no one thing is there, but with Us are its storehouses; and We send it not down but in settled measure:  And We send forth the fertilising winds, and cause the rain to come down from the heaven, and give you to drink of it; and it is not ye who are its storers:  And We cause to live and We cause to die,8 and We are the heir of all things:  We know those of you who flourish first and We know those who come later:  And truly thy Lord will gather them together again, for He is Wise, Knowing
  We created man of dried clay, of dark loam moulded;  And the djinn had We before created of subtle fire
  Remember when thy Lord said to the Angels, "I create man of dried clay, of dark loam moulded:  And when I shall have fashioned him and breathed of my spirit into him, then fall ye down and worship him
"  And the Angels bowed down in worship, all of them, all together,  Save Eblis: he refused to be with those who bowed in worship
  "O Eblis,"9 said God, "wherefore art thou not with those who bow down in worship?"  He said, "It beseemeth not me to bow in worship to man whom thou hast created of clay, of moulded loam
"  He said, "Begone then hence; thou art a stoned one,10  And the curse shall be on thee till the day of reckoning
"  He said, "O my Lord! respite me till the day when man shall be raised from the dead
"  He said, "One then of the respited shalt thou be  Till the day of the predestined time
"  He said, "O my Lord! because thou hast beguiled me, I will surely make all fair seeming to them11 on the earth; I will surely beguile them all;  Except such of them as shall be thy sincere servants
"  He said, "This is the right way with me;  For over none of my servants shalt thou have power, save those beguiled ones who shall follow thee
"  And verily, Hell is the promise for them one and all
  It hath seven Portals;12 at each Portal is a separate band of them;  But 'mid gardens and fountains shall the pious dwell:  "Enter ye therein in peace, secure-"  And all rancour will We remove from their bosoms: they shall sit as brethren, face to face, on couches:  Therein no weariness shall reach them, nor forth from it shall they be cast for ever
  Announce to my servants that I am the Gracious, the Merciful,  And that my chastisement is the grievous chastisement
  And tell them of Abraham's guests
  When they entered in unto him, and said, "Peace
"  "Verily," said he, "We fear you
"  They said, "Fear not, for of a sage son we bring thee tidings
"  He said, "Bring ye me such tidings now that old age hath come upon me? What, therefore, are your tidings really?"  They said, "We announce them to thee in very truth
 Be not then one of the despairing
"  "And who," said he, "despaireth of the mercy of his Lord, but they who err?"  He said, "What is your business then, O ye Sent Ones?"  They said, "We are sent unto a people who are sinners,  Except the family of Lot, whom verily we will rescue all,  Except his wife
 We have decreed that she shall be of those who linger
"  And when the Sent Ones came to the family of Lot  He said, "Yes; are persons unknown to me
"  They said, "Yes; but we have come to thee for a purpose about which thy people doubt:  We have come to thee with very truth, and we are truthful envoys
  Lead forth therefore thy family in the dead of the night; follow thou on their rear: and let no one of you turn round, but pass ye on whither ye are bidden
"  And this command we gave him because to the last man should these people be cut off at morning
  Then came the people of the city rejoicing at the news13-  He said, "These are my guests: therefore disgrace me not
  And fear God and put me not to shame
"  They said, "Have we not forbidden thee to entertain any one whatever?"14  He said, "Here are my daughters, if ye will thus act
"  As thou livest, O Muhammad, they were bewildered in the drunkenness of their lust
  So a tempest overtook them at their sunrise,  And we turned the city upside down, and we rained stones of baked clay upon them
  Verily, in this are signs for those who scan heedfully;  And these cities lay on the high road
15  Verily, in this are signs for the faithful
  The inhabitants also of El Aika16 were sinners:  So we took vengeance on them, and they both became a plain example
  And the people of HEDJR treated God's messengers as liars
  And we brought forth our signs to them, but they drew back from them:  And they hewed them out abodes in the mountains to secure them:  But a tempest surprised them at early morn,  And their labours availed them nothing
  We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that between them is, but for a worthy end
17 And verily, "the hour" shall surely come
 Wherefore do thou, Muhammad, forgive with kindly forgiveness,  For thy Lord! He is the Creator, the Wise
  We have already given thee the seven verses of repetition18 and the glorious Koran
  Strain not thine eyes after the good things we have bestowed on some of the unbelievers: afflict not thyself on their account, and lower thy wing to the faithful
19  And SAY: I am the only plain-spoken warner
  We will punish those who foster divisions,20  Who break up the Koran into parts:  By thy Lord! we will surely take account from them one and all,  Concerning that which they have done
  Profess publicly then what thou hast been bidden,21 and withdraw from those who join gods to God
  Verily, We will maintain thy cause against those who deride thee,  Who set up gods with God: and at last shall they know their folly
  Now know We that thy heart is distressed22 at what they say:  But do thou celebrate the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who bow down in worship;  And serve thy Lord till the certainty23 o'ertake thee

2 A recital of thy Lord's mercy to his servant Zachariah;  When he called upon his Lord with secret calling,  And said: "O Lord, verily my bones are weakened, and the hoar hairs glisten on my head,  And never, Lord, have I prayed to thee with ill success
  But now I have fears for my kindred after me;3 and my wife is barren:  Give me, then, a successor as thy special gift, who shall be my heir and an heir of the family of Jacob: and make him, Lord, well pleasing to thee
"  -"O Zachariah! verily we announce to thee a son,-his name John:  That name We have given to none before him
"4  He said: "O my Lord! how when my wife is barren shall I have a son, and when I have now reached old age, failing in my powers?"  He said: So shall it be
 Thy Lord hath said, Easy is this to me, for I created thee aforetime when thou wast nothing
"  He said: "Vouchsafe me, O my Lord! a sign
" He said: "Thy sign shall be that for three nights, though sound in health, thou speakest not to man
"  And he came forth from the sanctuary to his people, and made signs to them to sing praises morn and even
  We said: "O John! receive the Book with purpose of heart:"5-and We bestowed on him wisdom while yet a child;  And mercifulness from Ourself, and purity; and pious was he, and duteous to his parents; and not proud, rebellious
  And peace was on him on the day he was born, and the day of his death, and shall be on the day when he shall be raised to life!  And make mention in the Book, of Mary, when she went apart from her family, eastward,6  And took a veil to shroud herself from them:7 and we sent our spirit8 to her, and he took before her the form of a perfect man
9  She said: "I fly for refuge from thee to the God of Mercy! If thou fearest Him, begone from me
"  He said: "I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a holy son
"  She said: "How shall I have a son, when man hath never touched me? and I am not unchaste
"  He said: "So shall it be
 Thy Lord hath said: 'Easy is this with me;' and we will make him a sign to mankind, and a mercy from us
 For it is a thing decreed
"  And she conceived him,10 and retired with him to a far-off place
  And the throes came upon her11 by the trunk of a palm
 She said: "Oh, would that I had died ere this, and been a thing forgotten, forgotten quite!"  And one cried to her from below her:12 "Grieve not thou, thy Lord hath provided a streamlet at thy feet:-  And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee:13 it will drop fresh ripe dates upon thee
  Eat then and drink, and be of cheerful eye:14 and shouldst thou see a man,  Say,-Verily, I have vowed abstinence to the God of mercy
-To no one will I speak this day
"  Then came she with the babe to her people, bearing him
 They said, "O Mary! now hast thou done a strange thing!  O sister of Aaron!15 Thy father was not a man of wickedness, nor unchaste thy mother
"  And she made a sign to them, pointing towards the babe
 They said, "How shall we speak with him who is in the cradle, an infant?"  It said,16 "Verily, I am the servant of God; He hath given me the Book, and He hath made me a prophet;  And He hath made me blessed wherever I may be, and hath enjoined me prayer and almsgiving so long as I shall live;  And to be duteous to her that bare me: and he hath not made me proud, depraved
  And the peace of God was on me the day I was born, and will be the day I shall die, and the day I shall be raised to life
"  This is Jesus, the son of Mary; this is a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt
  It beseemeth not God to beget a son
 Glory be to Him! when he decreeth a thing, He only saith to it, Be, and it Is
17  And verily, God is my Lord and your Lord; adore Him then
 This is the right way
  But the Sects have fallen to variance among themselves about Jesus: but woe, because of the assembly of a great day, to those who believe not!  Make them hear, make them behold the day when they shall come before us! But the offenders this day are in a manifest error
  Warn them of the day of sighing when the decree shall be accomplished, while they are sunk in heedlessness and while they believe not
  Verily, we will inherit the earth and all who are upon it
 To us shall they be brought back
  Make mention also in the Book of Abraham; for he was a man of truth, a Prophet
18  When he said to his Father, "O my Father! why dost thou worship that which neither seeth nor heareth, nor profiteth thee aught?  O my Father! verily now hath knowledge come to me which hath not come to thee
 Follow me therefore-I will guide thee into an even path
  O my Father! worship not Satan, for Satan is a rebel against the God of Mercy
  O my Father! indeed I fear lest a chastisement from the God of Mercy light upon thee, and thou become Satan's vassal
"  He said, "Castest thou off my Gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will surely stone thee
 Begone from me for a length of time
"  He said, "Peace be on thee! I will pray my Lord for thy forgiveness, for he is gracious to me:  But I will separate myself from you, and the gods ye call on beside God, and on my Lord will I call
 Haply, my prayers to my Lord will not be with ill success
"  And when he had separated himself from them and that which they worshipped beside God, we bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them we made a prophet:  And we bestowed gifts on them in our mercy, and gave them the lofty tongue of truth
"19  And commemorate Moses in "the Book;" for he was a man of purity: moreover he was an Apostle, a Prophet:  From the right side of the mountain we called to him, and caused him to draw nigh to us for secret converse:  And we bestowed on him in our mercy his brother Aaron, a Prophet
  And commemorate Ismael in "the Book;" for he was true to his promise, and was an Apostle, a Prophet;  And he enjoined prayer and almsgiving on his people, and was well pleasing to his Lord
  And commemorate Edris20 in "the Book;" for he was a man of truth, a Prophet:  And we uplifted him to a place on high
21  These are they among the prophets of the posterity of Adam, and among those whom we bare with Noah, and among the posterity of Abraham and Israel, and among those whom we have guided and chosen, to whom God hath shewed favour
 When the signs of the God of Mercy were rehearsed to them, they bowed them down worshipping and weeping
  But others have come in their place after them: they have made an end of prayer, and have gone after their own lusts; and in the end they shall meet with evil:-  Save those who turn and believe and do that which is right, these shall enter the Garden, and in nought shall they be wronged:  The Garden of Eden, which the God of Mercy hath promised to his servants, though yet unseen:22 for his promise shall come to pass:  No vain discourse shall they hear therein, but only "Peace;" and their food shall be given them at morn and even:  This is the Paradise which we will make the heritage of those our servants who fear us
  We23 come not down from Heaven but by thy Lord's command
 His, whatever is before us and whatever is behind us, and whatever is between the two! And thy Lord is not forgetful,-  Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them! Worship Him, then, and abide thou steadfast in his worship
 Knowest thou any other of the same name?24  Man saith: "What! after I am dead, shall I in the end be brought forth alive?"  Doth not man bear in mind that we made him at first, when he was nought?  And I swear by thy Lord, we will surely gather together them and the Satans: then will we set them on their knees round Hell:  Then will we take forth from each band those of them who have been stoutest in rebellion against the God of Mercy:  Then shall we know right well to whom its burning is most due:  No one is there of you who shall not go down unto it25-This is a settled decree with thy Lord-  Then will we deliver those who had the fear of God, and the wicked will we leave in it on their knees
  And when our clear signs are rehearsed to them, the infidels say to those who believe: "Which of the two parties26 is in the best plight? and which is the most goodly company?"  But how many generations have we brought to ruin before them, who surpassed them in riches and in splendour!  SAY: As to those who are in error, the God of Mercy will lengthen out to them a length of days  Until they see that with which they are threatened, whether it be some present chastisement, or whether it be "the Hour," and they shall then know which is in the worse state, and which the more weak in forces:  But God will increase the guidance of the already guided
  And good works which abide, are in thy Lord's sight better in respect of guerdon, and better in the issue than all worldly good
  Hast thou marked him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, "I shall surely have riches and children bestowed upon me?"  Hath he mounted up into the secrets of God? Hath he made a compact with the God of Mercy?  No! we will certainly write down what he saith, and will lengthen the length of his chastisement:  And we will inherit what he spake of, and he shall come before us all alone
  They have taken other gods beside God to be their help
27  But it shall not be
 Those gods will disavow their worship and will become their enemies
  Seest thou not that we send the Satans against the Infidels to urge them into sin?  Wherefore be not thou in haste with them;28 for a small number of days do we number to them
  One day we will gather the God-fearing before the God of Mercy with honours due:29  But the sinners will we drive unto Hell, like flocks driven to the watering
  None shall have power to intercede, save he who hath received permission at the hands of the God of Mercy
  They say: "The God of Mercy hath gotten offspring
" Now have ye done a monstrous thing!  Almost might the very Heavens be rent thereat, and the Earth cleave asunder, and the mountains fall down in fragments,  That they ascribe a son to the God of Mercy, when it beseemeth not the God of Mercy to beget a son!  Verily there is none in the Heavens and in the Earth but shall approach the God of Mercy as a servant
 He hath taken note of them, and numbered them with exact numbering:  And each of them shall come to Him, on the day of Resurrection, singly:  But love will the God of Mercy vouchsafe to those who believe and do the things that be right
  Verily we have made this Koran easy and in thine own tongue, that thou mayest announce glad tidings by it to the God-fearing, and that thou mayest warn the contentious by it
  How many generations have we destroyed before them! Canst thou search out one of them? or canst thou hear a whisper from them?   _______________________  1 Comp

-88 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  SAD
1 By the Koran full of warning! In sooth the Infidels are absorbed in pride, in contention with thee
  How many generations have we destroyed before them! And they cried for mercy but no time was it of escape!  And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come to them; and the Infidels say, "This is a sorcerer, a liar:  Maketh he the gods to be but one god? A strange thing forsooth is this!"  And their chiefs took themselves off
 "Go, said they, and cleave steadfastly2 to your gods
 Ye see the thing aimed at
  We heard not of this in the previous creed
3 It is but an imposture:  To him alone of us all hath a book of warning been sent down?" Yes! they are in doubt as to my warnings, for they have not yet tasted my vengeance
  Are the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the bounteous, in their hands?  Is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them theirs? Then let them mount up by cords!  Any army of the confederates4 shall here be routed
  Before them the people of Noah and Ad and Pharaoh the impaler5 treated their prophets as impostors;  And Themoud, and the people of Lot, and the dwellers in the forest: these were the confederates
  Nought did they all but charge the apostles with falsehood: Just, therefore, the retribution
  And these (Meccans) await but one single trumpet blast-There shall be no delaying it-  Yet they dare to say, "O our Lord! hasten our lot to us, before the day of reckoning
"  Put thou up with what they say: and remember our servant David, a man strong of hand6, one who turned him to Us in penitence:  We constrained the mountains7 to join with him in lauds at even and at sunrise;  And the birds which flocked to him, and would all return to him oft;  And we stablished his kingdom: and wisdom, and skill to pronounce clear decisions, did we bestow on him
  Hath the story of the two pleaders8 reached thee, O Muhammad, when they mounted the walls of his closet?  When they entered in upon David, and he was frightened at them, they said, "Be not afraid; we are two opposing parties: one of us hath wronged the other
 Judge therefore with truth between us, and be not unjust, but guide us to the right way
  Now this my brother had ninety and nine ewes, and I had but a single ewe; and he said, make me her keeper
 And he over-persuaded me in the dispute
"  He said, "Certainly he hath wronged thee in asking for thine ewe to add her to his own ewes: and truly many associates do one another wrong-except those who believe and do the things that are right; and few indeed are they!" And David perceived that we had tried him; so he asked pardon of his Lord, and fell down and bowed himself and repented
  So we forgave him that his sin; and truly he shall have a high rank with Us, and an excellent retreat in Paradise
  O David! verily we have made thee our vicegerent upon earth
 Judge therefore between men with truth, and follow not thy passions, lest they cause thee to err from the way of God
 For they who err from the way of God shall meet with a grievous chastisement, for that they have forgotten the day of reckoning
  We have not created the heaven and the earth and what is between them for nought
 That is the thought of infidels; but woe to the infidels because of the fire!  Shall we treat those who believe and do the things that are right like those who propagate evil on earth? Shall we treat the God-fearing like the impious?  A blessed Book9 have we sent down to thee, that men may meditate its verses, and that those endued with understanding may bear it in mind
  And Solomon gave we unto David
 An excellent servant, for he loved to turn him Godward
  Remember when at eventide the prancing10 chargers were displayed before him,  And he said, "Truly I have loved the love of earthly goods above the remembrance of my Lord, till the sun hath been hidden by the veil of darkness
11  Bring them back to me
" And he began to sever the legs and necks
  We also made trial of Solomon, and placed a phantom12 on his throne: whereupon he returned to Us (in penitence)
  He said, O my Lord! pardon me, and give me a dominion that may not be to any one beside me, for thou art the liberal giver
  So we subjected the wind to him; it ran softly at his bidding, whithersoever he directed it:  And the Satans-every builder and diver-  And others bound in chains:13  "This," said we, "is our gift: be bounteous then, or withhold thy favours; no account shalt thou render
"  And his rank also is high with Us, and an excellent retreat
  And remember our servant Job when he cried to his Lord, "Verily, Satan hath laid on me disease and pain
"  "Stamp," said we, "with thy foot
 This14 is to wash with; cool, and to drink
"  And we gave him back his family, and as many more with them in our mercy; and for a monition to men of judgment
  And we said, "Take in thine hand a rod, and strike15 with it, nor break thine oath
" Verily, we found him patient!  How excellent a servant, one who turned to Us was he!  And remember our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, men of might and vision
16  With this cleansing did we cleanse them the remembrance of the abode of Paradise
  And verily, they were, in our sight, of the elect and of the good
  And remember Ishmael and Elisha and Dhoulkefl, for all these were of the just
  This is a monition: and verily, the pious shall have a goodly retreat:  Gardens of Eden, whose portals shall stand open to them:  Therein reclining, they shall there call for many a fruit and drink:  And with them shall be virgins of their own age, with modest retiring glances:  "This is what ye were promised at the day of reckoning
"  "Yes! this is our provision: it shall never fail
"  Even so
 But for the evil doers is a wretched home-  Hell-wherein they shall be burned: how wretched a bed!  Even so
 Let them then taste it-boiling water and gore,  And other things of kindred sort!  To their leaders it shall be said, "This company shall be thrown in headlong with you
 No greetings shall await them, for they shall be burned in the fire
"  They shall say: "But ye, too! there shall be no welcome for you
 It was ye who prepared this for us, and wretched is the abode!"  They will say: "O our Lord! increase twofold in the fire, the punishment of him who hath brought this upon us
"  And they will say: "Why see we not the men whom we numbered among the wicked-  Whom we used to treat with scorn? Have they escaped our eyes?"17  Verily this is truth-the wrangling together of the people of the fire
  SAY: I am but a warner; and there is no God but God the One, the Almighty!  Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them,18 the Potent, the Forgiving!  SAY: this is a weighty message,19  From which ye turn aside!  Yet had I no knowledge of what passed among the celestial chiefs when they disputed,20  -Verily, it hath been revealed to me only because I am a public preacher-  When thy Lord said to the angels, "I am about to make man of clay,21  And when I have formed him and breathed my spirit into him, then worshipping fall down before him
"  And the angels prostrated themselves, all of them with one accord,  Save Eblis
 He swelled with pride, and became an unbeliever
  "O Eblis," said God, "what hindereth thee from prostrating thyself before him whom my hands have made?  Is it that thou are puffed up with pride? or art thou a being of lofty merit?"  He said: "I am more excellent than he; me hast thou created of fire:22 of clay hast thou created him
"  He said: "Begone then hence: thou art accursed,23  And lo! my ban shall be on thee till the day of the reckoning
"  He said: "O my Lord! respite me till the day of Resurrection
"  He said, "One then of the respited shalt thou be,  Till the day of the time appointed
"  He said: "I swear by thy might then that all of them will I seduce,  Save thy sincere servants among them
"  He said: "It is truth, and the truth I speak
 From thee will I surely fill Hell, and with such of them as shall follow thee, one and all
  Say: I ask no wage of you for this, nor am I one who intermeddleth
  Of a truth the Koran is no other than a warning to all creatures
  And after a time shall ye surely know its message

-83 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  YA
 SIN
1 By the wise Koran!  Surely of the Sent Ones, Thou,  Upon a right path!  A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful,  That thou shouldest warn a people whose fathers were not warned and therefore lived in heedlessness!  Just, now, is our sentence2 against most of them; therefore they shall not believe
  On their necks have we placed chains which reach the chin, and forced up are their heads:  Before them have we set a barrier and behind them a barrier, and we have shrouded them in a veil, so that they shall not see
  Alike is it to them if thou warn them or warn them not: they will not believe
  Him only shalt thou really warn, who followeth the monition and feareth the God of mercy in secret: him cheer with tidings of pardon, and of a noble recompense
  Verily, it is We who will quicken the dead, and write down the works which they have sent on before them, and the traces which they shall have left behind them: and everything have we set down in the clear Book of our decrees
3  Set forth to them the instance of the people of the city4 when the Sent Ones came to it
  When we sent two unto them and they charged them both with imposture- therefore with a third we strengthened them: and they said, "Verily we are the Sent unto you of God
"  They said, "Ye are only men like us: Nought hath the God of Mercy sent down
 Ye do nothing but lie
"  They said, "Our Lord knoweth that we are surely sent unto you;  To proclaim a clear message is our only duty
"  They said, "Of a truth we augur ill from you:5 if ye desist not we will surely stone you, and a grievous punishment will surely befall you from us
"  They said, "Your augury of ill is with yourselves
 Will ye be warned?6 Nay, ye are an erring people
"  Then from the end of the city a man came running:7 He said, "O my people! follow the Sent Ones;  Follow those who ask not of you a recompense, and who are rightly guided
  And why should I not worship Him who made me, and to whom ye shall be brought back?  Shall I take gods beside Him? If the God of Mercy be pleased to afflict me, their intercession will not avert from me aught, nor will they deliver:  Truly then should I be in a manifest error
  Verily, in your Lord have I believed; therefore hear me
"8  -It was said to him, "Enter thou into Paradise:" And he said, "Oh that my people knew  How gracious God hath been to me, and that He hath made me one of His honoured ones
"  But no army sent we down out of heaven after his death, nor were we then sending down our angels-  There was but one shout from Gabriel, and lo! they were extinct
  Oh! the misery that rests upon my servants! No apostle cometh to them but they laugh him to scorn
  See they not how many generations we have destroyed before them?  Not to false gods is it that they shall be brought9 back,  But all, gathered together, shall be set before Us
  Moreover, the dead earth is a sign to them: we quicken it and bring forth the grain from it, and they eat thereof:  And we make in it gardens of the date and vine; and we cause springs to gush forth in it;  That they may eat of its fruits and of the labour of their hands
 Will they not therefore be thankful?  Glory be to Him, who hath created all the sexual pairs of such things as Earth produceth,10 and of mankind themselves; and of things beyond their ken!  A sign to them also is the Night
 We withdraw the day from it, and lo! they are plunged in darkness;  And the Sun hasteneth to her place of rest
 This, the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing!  And as for the Moon, We have decreed stations for it, till it change like an old and crooked palm branch
  To the Sun it is not given to overtake the Moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day; but each in its own sphere doth journey on
  It is also a sign to them that we bare their posterity in the full-laden Ark;  And that we have made for them vessels like it on which they embark;  And if we please, we drown them, and there is none to help them, and they are not rescued,  Unless through our mercy, and that they may enjoy themselves for yet awhile
  And when it is said to them, Fear what is before you and what is behind you,11 that ye may obtain mercy
 
 
 
  Aye, not one sign from among the signs of their Lord dost thou bring them, but they turn away from it!  And when it is said to them, Give alms of what God hath bestowed on you,12 they who believe not say to the believers, "Shall we feed him whom God can feed if He will? Truly ye are in no other than a plain error
"  And they say, "When will this promise be fulfilled, if what ye say be true?"  They await but a single blast: as they are wrangling shall it assail them:  And not a bequest shall they be able to make, nor to their families shall they return
  And the trumpet shall be blown, and, lo! they shall speed out of their sepulchres to their Lord:  They shall say, "Oh! woe to us! who hath roused us from our sleeping place? 'Tis what the God of Mercy promised; and the Apostles spake the truth
"  But one blast shall there be,13 and, lo! they shall be assembled before us, all together
  And on that day shall no soul be wronged in the least: neither shall ye be rewarded but as ye shall have wrought
  But joyous on that day shall be the inmates of Paradise, in their employ;  In shades, on bridal couches reclining, they and their spouses:  Therein shall they have fruits, and shall have whatever they require-  "Peace!" shall be the word on the part of a merciful Lord
  "But be ye separated this day, O ye sinners!  Did I not enjoin on you, O sons of Adam, 'Worship not Satan, for that he is your declared foe,'  But 'Worship Me: this is a right path'?  But now hath he led a vast host of you astray
 Did ye not then comprehend?  This is Hell with which ye were threatened:  Endure its heat this day, for that ye believed not
"  On that day will we set a seal upon their mouths; yet shall their hands speak unto us, and their feet14 shall bear witness of that which they shall have done
  And, if we pleased, we would surely put out their eyes: yet even then would they speed on with rivalry in their path: but how should they see?  And, if we pleased, we would surely transform them as they stand,15 and they would not be able to move onward, or to return
  Him cause we to stoop through age whose days we lengthen
 Will they not understand?  We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry,16 nor would it beseem him
 This Book is no other than a warning and a clear Koran,  To warn whoever liveth; and, that against the Infidels sentence may be justly given
  See they not that we have created for them among the things which our hands have wrought, the animals of which they are masters?  And that we have subjected them unto them? And on some they ride, and of others they eat;  And they find in them profitable uses and beverages:  Yet have they taken other gods beside God that they might be helpful to them
  No power have they to succour them: yet are their votaries an army at their service
  Let not their speech grieve thee: We know what they hide and what they bring to light
  Doth not man perceive that we have created him of the moist germs of life? Yet lo! is he an open caviller
  And he meeteth us with arguments,17 and forgetteth his creation: "Who," saith he, "shall give life to bones when they are rotten?"  SAY: He shall give life to them who gave them being at first, for in all creation is he skilled:  Who even out of the green tree hath given you fire18, and lo! ye kindle flame from it
  What! must not He who hath created the Heavens and the Earth be mighty enough to create your likes? Yes! and He is the skilful creator
  His command when He willeth aught, is but to say to it, BE, and IT IS
  So glory be to Him in whose hand is sway over all things! And to Him shall ye be brought back

We have made it an Arabic Koran that ye may understand:  And it is a transcript of the archetypal Book,2 kept by us; it is lofty, filled with wisdom,  Shall we then turn aside this warning from you because ye are a people who transgress?  Yet how many prophets sent we among those of old!  But no prophet came to them whom they made not the object of their scorn:  Wherefore we destroyed nations mightier than these Meccans in strength; and the example of those of old hath gone before!  And if thou ask them who created the Heavens and the Earth, they will say: "The Mighty, the Sage, created them both,"  Who hath made the Earth as a couch for you, and hath traced out routes therein for your guidance;  And who sendeth down out of Heaven the rain in due degree, by which we quicken a dead land; thus shall ye be brought forth from the grave:  And who hath created the sexual couples, all of them, and hath made for you the ships and beasts whereon ye ride:  That ye may sit balanced on their backs and remember the goodness of your Lord as ye sit so evenly thereon, and say: "Glory to Him who hath subjected these to us!

"  Yet do they assign to him some of his own servants for offspring! Verily man is an open ingrate!  Hath God adopted daughters from among those whom he hath created, and chosen sons for you?  But when that3 is announced to any one of them, which he affirmeth to be the case with the God of Mercy,4 his face settleth into darkness and he is silent-sad
  What! make they a being to be the offspring of God who is brought up among trinkets, and is ever contentious without reason?  And they make the angels who are the servants of God of Mercy, females
 What! did they witness their creation? Their witness shall be taken down, and they shall hereafter be enquired at
  And they say: "Had the God of Mercy so willed it we should never have worshipped them
" No knowledge have they in this: they only lie
  Have we ere this given them a Book?5 and do they possess it still?  But say they: "Verily we found our fathers of that persuasion, and verily, by their footsteps do we guide ourselves
"  And thus never before thy time did we send a warner to any city but its wealthy ones said: "Verily we found our fathers with a religion, and in their tracks we tread
"  SAY,-such was our command to that apostle-"What! even if I bring you a religion more right than that ye found your fathers following?" And they said, "Verily we believe not in your message
"  Wherefore we took vengeance on them, and behold what hath been the end of those who treated our messengers as liars!  And bear in mind when Abraham said to his father and to his people, "Verily I am clear of what ye worship,  Save Him who hath created me; for he will vouchsafe me guidance
"  And this he established as a doctrine that should abide among his posterity, that to God might they be turned
  In sooth to these idolatrous Arabians and to their fathers did I allow their full enjoyments, till the truth should come to them, and an undoubted apostle:  But now that the truth hath come to them, they say, "'Tis sorcery, and we believe it not
"  And they say, "Had but this Koran been sent down to some great one of the two cities6 
 
 
!"  Are they then the distributors of thy Lord's Mercy?7 It is we who distribute their subsistence among them in this world's life; and we raise some of them by grades above others, that the one may take the other to serve him: but better is the mercy of thy Lord than all their hoards
  But for fear that all mankind would have become a single people of unbelievers, verily we would certainly have given to those who believe not in the God of Mercy roofs of silver to their houses, and silver stairs to ascend by;  And doors of silver to their houses, and couches of silver to recline on;  And ORNAMENTS OF GOLD: for all these are merely the good things of the present life; but the next life doth thy Lord reserve for those who fear Him
  And whoso shall withdraw from the Warning of the God of Mercy, we will chain a Satan to him, and he shall be his fast companion:  For the Satans will turn men aside from the Way, who yet shall deem themselves rightly guided;  Until when man shall come before us, he shall say, "O Satan, would that between me and thee were the distance of the East and West
"8 And a wretched companion is a Satan
  But it shall not avail you on that day, because ye were unjust: partners shall ye be in the torment
  What! Canst thou then make the deaf to hear, or guide the blind and him who is in palpable error?  Whether therefore we take thee off by death, surely will we avenge ourselves on them;  Or whether we make thee a witness of the accomplishment of that with which we threatened them, we will surely gain the mastery over them
9  Hold thou fast therefore what hath been revealed to thee, for thou art on a right path:  For truly to thee and to thy people it is an admonition; and ye shall have an account to render for it at last
10  And ask our Sent Ones whom we have sent before thee,  "Appointed we gods beside the God of Mercy whom they should worship?"11  Of old sent we Moses with our signs to Pharaoh and his nobles: and he said, "I truly am the Apostle of the Lord of the worlds
"  And when he presented himself before them with our signs, lo! they laughed at them,  Though we shewed them no sign that was not greater than its fellow:12 and therefore did we lay hold on them with chastisement, to the intent that they might be turned to God
  Then they said, "O Magician! call on thy Lord on our behalf to do as he hath engaged with thee, for truly we would fain be guided
"  But when we relieved them from the chastisement, lo! they broke their pledge
  And Pharaoh made proclamation among his people
 Said he, "O my people! is not the kingdom of Egypt mine, and these rivers which flow at my feet?13 Do ye not behold?  Am I not mightier than this despicable fellow,  And who scarce can speak distinctly?  Have bracelets of gold14 then been put upon him, or come there with him a train of Angels?"  And he inspired his people with levity, and they obeyed him; for they were a perverse people:  And when they had angered us, we took vengeance on them, and we drowned them all
  And we made them a precedent and instance of divine judgments to those who came after them
  And when the Son of Mary was set forth as an instance of divine power, lo! thy people cried out for joy thereat:  And they said, "Are our gods or is he the better?"15 They put this forth to thee only in the spirit of dispute
 Yea, they are a contentious people
  Jesus is no more than a servant whom we favoured, and proposed as an instance of divine power to the children of Israel
  (And if we pleased, we could from yourselves bring forth Angels to succeed you on earth:)16  And he shall be a sign of the last hour;17 doubt not then of it, and follow ye me: this is the right way;  And let not Satan turn you aside from it, for he is your manifest foe
  And when Jesus came with manifest proofs, he said, "Now am I come to you with wisdom; and a part of those things about which ye are at variance I will clear up to you; fear ye God therefore and obey me
  Verily, God is my Lord and your Lord; wherefore worship ye him: this is a right way
"  But the different parties18 fell into disputes among themselves; but woe to those who thus transgressed, because of the punishment of an afflictive day!  For what wait they but for the hour "to come suddenly on them, while they expect it not?"  Friends on that day shall become foes to one another, except the God- fearing:-  "O my servants! on this day shall no fear come upon you, neither shall ye be put to grief,  Who have believed in our signs and become Muslims:  Enter ye and your wives into Paradise, delighted
"  Dishes and bowls of gold shall go round unto them: there shall they enjoy whatever their souls desire, and whatever their eyes delight in; and therein shall ye abide for ever
  This is Paradise, which ye have received as your heritage in recompense for your works;  Therein shall ye have fruits in abundance, of which ye shall eat
  But in the torment of Hell shall the wicked remain for ever:  It shall not be mitigated to them, and they shall be mute for despair therein,  For it is not we who have treated them unjustly, but it was they who were unjust to themselves
  And they shall cry: "O Malec!19 would that thy Lord would make an end of us!" He saith: "Here must ye remain
"  We have come to you with the truth (O Meccans), but most of you abhor the truth
  Have they drawn tight their toils for thee?20 We too will tighten ours
  Think they that we hear not their secrets and their private talk? Yes, and our angels who are at their sides write them down
  SAY: If the God of Mercy had a son, the first would I be to worship him:  But far be the Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, the Lord of the Throne, from that which they impute to Him!  Wherefore let them alone, to plunge on, and sport, until they meet the day with which they are menaced
  He who is God in the Heavens is God in earth also: and He is the Wise, the Knowing
  And Blessed be He whose is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them; for with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him shall ye be brought back
  The gods whom they call upon beside Him shall not be able to intercede for others: they only shall be able who bore witness to the truth and21 knew it
"  If thou ask them who hath created them, they will be sure to say, "God
" How then hold they false opinions?  And one22 saith, "O Lord! verily these are people who believe not
"  Turn thou then from them, and say, "Peace:" In the end they shall know their folly

-DJINN [LXII
]  MECCA
-28 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  SAY: It hath been revealed to me that a company of  DJINN1 listened, and said,-"Verily, we have heard a marvellous discourse (Koran);  It guideth to the truth; wherefore we believed in it, and we will not henceforth join any being with our Lord;  And He,-may the majesty of our Lord be exalted!-hath taken no spouse neither hath he any offspring
  But the foolish among us hath spoken of God that which is unjust:  And we verily thought that no one amongst men or Djinn would have uttered a lie against God
  There are indeed people among men, who have sought for refuge unto people among Djinn: but they only increased their folly:  And they thought, as ye think, that God would not raise any from the dead
  And the Heavens did we essay, but found them filled with a mighty garrison, and with flaming darts;  And we sat on some of the seats to listen, but whoever listeneth findeth an ambush ready for him of flaming darts
  And truly we know not whether evil be meant for them that are on earth, or whether their Lord meaneth guidance for them
  And there are among us good, and others among us of another kind;-we are of various sorts:  And verily we thought that no one could weaken God on earth, neither could we escape from him by flight:  Wherefore as soon as we had heard 'the guidance' we believed in it; and whoever believeth in his Lord, need not fear either loss or wrong
  There are some among us who have resigned themselves to God (the Muslims); and there are others of us who have gone astray
 And whoso resigneth himself to God pursueth the way of truth;  But they who go astray from it shall be fuel for Hell
"  Moreover, if they (the Meccans) keep straight on in that way, we will surely give them to drink of abundant waters,  That we may prove them thereby: but whoso withdraweth from the remembrance of his Lord, him will He send into a severe torment
  It is unto God that the temples are set apart: call not then on any other therein with God
  When the servant of God stood up to call upon Him, the djinn almost jostled him by their crowds
  SAY: I call only upon my Lord, and I join no other being with Him
  SAY: No control have I over what may hurt or benefit you
  SAY: Verily none can protect me against God;  Neither shall I find any refuge beside Him
  My sole work is preaching from God, and His message: and for such as shall rebel against God and his apostle is the fire of Hell! they shall remain therein alway,-for ever!  Until they see their threatened vengeance they will be perverse! but then shall they know which side was the weakest in a protector and the fewest in number
  SAY: I know not whether that with which ye are threatened be nigh, or whether my Lord hath assigned it to a distant day: He knoweth the secret, nor doth He divulge his secret to any,  Except to that Apostle who pleaseth Him; and before him and behind him He maketh a guard to march:  That He may know if his Apostles have verily delivered the messages of their Lord: and He embraceth in his knowledge all their ways, and taketh count of all that concerneth them

-THE KINGDOM [LXIII
]  MECCA
- 30 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  BLESSED be He is whose hand is the KINGDOM! and over all things is He potent:  Who hath created death and life to prove which of you will be most righteous in deed; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving!  Who hath created seven Heavens one above another: No defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: seest thou a single flaw?  Then twice more repeat the gaze: thy gaze shall return to thee dulled and weary
  Moreover we have decked the lowest heaven with lights, and have placed them there to be hurled at the Satans, for whom we have prepared the torment of the flaming fire
  And for those who believe not in their Lord is the torment of Hell; and horrid the journey thither!  When they shall be thrown into it, they shall hear it braying:1 and it shall boil-  Almost shall it burst for fury
 So oft as a crowd shall be thrown into it, its keepers shall ask them, "Came not the warner to you?"  They shall say, Yes! there came to us one charged with warnings; but we treated him as a liar, and said, "Nothing hath God sent down: ye are in nothing but a vast delusion
"  And they shall say, "Had we but hearkened or understood, we had not been among the dwellers in the flames;"  And their sin shall they acknowledge: but, "Avaunt, ye dwellers in the flame
"  But pardon and a great reward for those who fear their Lord in secret!  Be your converse hidden or open, He truly knoweth the inmost recess of your breasts!  What! shall He not know who hath created? for He is the Subtil,2 the Cognizant
  It is He who hath made the earth level for you: traverse then its broad sides, and eat of what He hath provided
-Unto Him shall be the resurrection
  What! are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not cleave the Earth beneath you? And lo, it shall quake
  Or are ye sure that He who is in Heaven will not send against you a stone- charged whirlwind? Then shall ye know what my warning meant!  And verily, those who flourish before you treated their prophets as liars: and how grievous my wrath!  Behold they not the birds over their heads, outstretching and drawing in their wings? None, save the God of Mercy, upholdeth them: for he regardeth all things
  Who is he that can be as an army to you, to succour you, except the God of Mercy? Truly, the infidels are in the merest delusion
  Or who is he that will furnish you supplies, if He withhold His supplies? Yet do they persist in pride and in fleeing from Him!  Is he who goeth along grovelling on his face, better guided than he who goeth upright on a straight path?  SAY: It is He who hath brought you forth, and gifted you with hearing and sight and heart: yet how few are grateful!  SAY: It is He who hath sown you in the earth, and to Him shall ye be gathered
  And they say, "When shall this threat be put in force, if ye speak the truth?"  SAY: Nay truly, this knowledge is with God alone: and I am only an open warner
  But when they shall see it nigh, sad shall wax the countenances of the infidels: and it shall be said, "This is what ye have been calling for
"  SAY: What think ye? Whether God destroy me or not, and those who follow me, or whether he have mercy on us, yet who will protect the infidels from a woeful torment?  SAY: He is the God of Mercy: in Him do we believe, and in Him put we our trust; and ye shall know hereafter who is in a manifest error
  SAY: What think ye? If at early morn your waters shall have sunk away, who then will give you clear running water?   _______________________  1 Thus Shakespeare uses the word braying of clamours of Hell; and Milton speaks of braying horrible discord

-THE BELIEVERS [LXIV
]  MECCA
1-118 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  HAPPY now the BELIEVERS,  Who humble them in their prayer,  And who keep aloof from vain words,2  And who are doers of alms deeds,  And who restrain their appetites,  (Save with their wives, or the slaves whom their right hands possess: for in that case they shall be free from blame:  But they whose desires reach further than this are transgressors:)  And who tend well their trusts and their covenants,  And who keep them strictly to their prayers:  These shall be the heritors,  Who shall inherit the paradise, to abide therein for ever
  Now of fine clay have we created man:  Then we placed him, a moist germ,3 in a safe abode;  Then made we the moist germ a clot of blood: then made the clotted blood into a piece of flesh; then made the piece of flesh into bones: and we clothed the bones with flesh: then brought forth man of yet another make4-Blessed therefore be God, the most excellent of Makers5-  Then after this ye shall surely die:  Then shall ye be waked up on the day of resurrection
  And we have created over you seven heavens:6-and we are not careless of the creation
  And we send down water from the Heaven in its due degree, and we cause it to settle on the earth;-and we have power for its withdrawal:-  And by it we cause gardens of palm trees, and vineyards to spring forth for you, in which ye have plenteous fruits, and whereof ye eat;  And the tree that groweth up on Mount Sinai; which yieldeth oil and a juice for those who eat
  And there is a lesson for you in the cattle: We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, and many advantages do ye derive from them, and for food they serve you;  And on them and on ships are ye borne
  We sent Noah heretofore unto his people, and he said, "O my people! serve God: ye have no other God than He: will ye not therefore fear Him?  But the chiefs of the people who believed not said, "This is but a man like yourselves: he fain would raise himself above you: but had it pleased God to send, He would have sent angels: We heard not of this with our sires of old;-  Verily he is but a man possessed; leave him alone therefore for a time
"  He said, "O my Lord! help me against their charge of imposture
"  So we revealed unto him, "Make the ark under our eye, and as we have taught, and when our doom shall come on, and the earth's surface shall boil up,7  Carry into it of every kind a pair, and thy family, save him on whom sentence hath already passed: and plead not with me for the wicked, for they shall be drowned
  And when thou, and they who shall be with thee, shall go up into the ark; say, 'Praise be unto God, who hath rescued us from the wicked folk
'  And say, 'O my Lord! disembark me with a blessed disembarking: for thou art the best to disembark
"'  Verily in this were signs, and verily we made proof of man
  We then raised up other generations after them;  And we sent among them an apostle from out themselves, with, "Worship ye God! ye have no other God than He: will ye not therefore fear Him?"  And the chiefs of His people who believed not, and who deemed the meeting with us in the life to come to be a lie, and whom we had richly supplied in this present life, said, "This is but a man like yourselves; he eateth of what ye eat,  And he drinketh of what ye drink:  And if ye obey a man like yourselves, then ye will surely be undone
  What! doth he foretell you, that after ye shall be dead and become dust and bones, ye shall be brought forth?  Away, away with his predictions!  There is no life beyond our present life; we die, and we live, and we shall not be quickened again!  This is merely a man who forgeth a lie about God: and we will not believe him
"  He said, "O my Lord! help me against this charge of imposture
"  He said, "Yet a little, and they will soon repent them!"  Then did the shout of the destroying angel in justice surprise them, we made them like leaves swept down by a torrent
 Away then with the wicked people!  Then raised we up other generations after them-  Neither too soon, nor too late, shall a people reach its appointed time-  Then sent we our apostles one after another
 Oft as their apostle presented himself to a nation, they treated him as a liar; and we caused one nation to follow another; and we made them the burden of a tale
 Away then with the people who believe not!  Then sent we Moses and his brother Aaron, with our signs and manifest power,  To Pharaoh and his princes; but they behaved them proudly, for they were a haughty people
  And they said, "Shall we believe on two men like ourselves, whose people are our slaves?"  And they treated them both as impostors; wherefore they became of the destroyed
  And we gave Moses the Book for Israel's guidance
  And we appointed the Son of Mary, and His mother for a sign; and we prepared an abode for both in a lofty spot,8 quiet, and watered with springs
  "O ye apostles! eat of things that are good: and do that which is right: of your doings I am cognisant
  And truly this your religion is the one religion;9 and I am your Lord: therefore fear me
"  But men have rent their great concern, one among another, into sects; every party rejoicing in that which is their own;  Wherefore leave them till a certain time, in their depths of error
  What! think they that what we largely, bestow on them of wealth and children,  We hasten to them for their good? Nay, they have no knowledge
  But they who are awed with the dread of their Lord,  And who believe in the signs of their Lord,  And who join no other gods with their Lord,  And who give that which they give with hearts thrilled with dread because they must return unto their Lord,  These hasten after good, and are the first to win it
  We will not burden a soul beyond its power: and with us is a book, which speaketh the truth; and they shall not be wronged:  But as to this Book, their hearts are plunged in error, and their works are far other than those of Muslims, and they will work those works,  Until when we lay hold on their affluent ones with punishment; lo! they cry for help:  -"Cry not for help this day, for by Us ye shall not be succoured:  Long since were my signs rehearsed to you, but ye turned back on your heels,  Puffed up with pride, discoursing foolishly by night
"  Do they not then heed the things spoken-whether that hath come to them which came not to their fathers of old?  Or do they not recognise their apostle; and therefore disavow him?  Or say they, "A Djinn is in him?" Nay! he hath come to them with the truth; but the truth do most of them abhor
  But if the truth had followed in the train of their desires, the heavens and the earth, and all that therein is, had surely come to ruin! But we have brought them their warning; and from their warning they withdraw
  Dost thou ask them for remuneration? But, remuneration from thy Lord is best; and He is the best provider
  And thou indeed biddest them to the right path;  But verily they who believe not in the life to come, from that path do surely wander!  And if we had taken compassion on them, and relieved them from their trouble, they would have plunged on in their wickedness, wildly wandering
10  We formerly laid hold on them with chastisement, yet they did not humble them to their Lord, nor did they abase them;  Until, when we have opened upon them the door of a severe punishment, lo! they are in despair at it
  It is He who hath implanted in you hearing, and sight, and heart; how few of you give thanks!  It is He who hath caused you to be born on the earth: and unto Him shall ye be gathered
  And it is He who maketh alive and killeth, and of Him is the change of the night and of the day: Will ye not understand?  But they say, as said those of old:-  They say,"What! When we shall be dead, and have become dust and bones, shall we, indeed, be waked to life?  This have we been promised, we and our fathers aforetime: but it is only fables of the ancients
"  SAY: Whose is the earth, and all that is therein;-if ye know?  They will answer, "God's
" SAY: Will ye not, then reflect?  SAY: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the glorious throne?  They will say, "They are God's"
 SAY: Will ye not, then, fear Him?  SAY: In whose hand is the empire of all things, who protecteth but is not protected? if ye know:  They will answer, "In God's
" SAY: How, then, can ye be so spell-bound?  Yea, we have brought them the truth; but they are surely liars:  God hath not begotten offspring; neither is there any other God with Him: else had each god assuredly taken away that which he had created,11 and some had assuredly uplifted themselves above others! Far from the glory of God, be what they affirm of Him!  He knoweth alike the unseen and the seen: far be He uplifted above the gods whom they associate with Him!  SAY: O my Lord! If thou wilt let me witness the infliction of that with which they have been threatened!  O my Lord! place me not among the ungodly people
  Verily, we are well able to make thee see the punishment with which we have threatened them
  Turn aside evil with that which is better: we best know what they utter against thee
  And SAY: "O my Lord! I betake me to Thee, against the promptings of the Satans:  And I betake me to Thee, O my Lord! that they gain no hurtful access to me
"  When death overtaketh one of the wicked, he saith, "Lord, send me back again,  That I may do the good which I have left undone
"12 "By no means
" These are the very words which he shall speak:  But behind them shall be a barrier, until the day when they shall be raised again
  And when the trumpet shall be sounded, the ties of kindred between them shall cease on that day; neither shall they ask each other's help
  They whose balances shall be heavy, shall be the blest
  But they whose balances shall be light,-these are they who shall lose their souls, abiding in hell for ever:  The fire shall scorch their faces, and their lips shall quiver therein:-  -"What! Were not my signs rehearsed unto you? and did ye not treat them as lies?"  They shall say, "O our Lord! our ill-fortune prevailed against us, and we became an erring people
  O our Lord! Bring us forth hence: if we go back again to our sins, we shall indeed be evil doers
"  He will say; "Be ye driven down into it; and, address me not
"  A part truly of my servants was there, who said, "O our Lord! we believe: forgive us, then, and be merciful to us, for of the merciful art thou the best
"  But ye received them with such scoffs that they suffered you to forget my warning, and ye laughed them to scorn
  Verily this day will I reward then, for their patient endurance: the blissful ones shall they be!  He will say, "What number of years tarried ye on earth?"  They will say, "We tarried a day, or part of a day;13 but ask the recording angels
"14  God will say, "Short indeed was the time ye tarried, if that ye knew it
  What! Did ye then think that we had created you for pastime, and that ye should not be brought back again to us?" Wherefore let God be exalted, the King, the Truth! There is no god but He! Lord of the stately throne! And whoso, together with God, shall call on another god, for whom he hath no proof, shall surely have to give account to his Lord
 Aye, it shall fare ill with the infidels
  And SAY: "O my Lord, pardon, and have mercy; for of those who show mercy, art thou the best

-112 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  THIS people's reckoning hath drawn nigh, yet, sunk in carelessness, they turn aside
  Every fresh warning that cometh to them from their Lord they only hear to mock it,-  Their hearts set on lusts: and they who have done this wrong say in secret discourse, "Is He more than a man like yourselves? What! will ye, with your eyes open,1 accede to sorcery?"  SAY: "My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and on the earth: He is the Hearer, the Knower
"  "Nay," say they, "it is the medley of dreams: nay, he hath forged it: nay, he is a poet: let him come to us with a sign as the prophets of old were sent
"  Before their time, none of the cities which we have destroyed, believed: will these men, then, believe?  And we sent none, previous to thee, but men to whom we had revealed ourselves
 Ask ye the people who are warned by Scriptures,2 if ye know it not
  We gave them not bodies which could dispense with food: and they were not to live for ever
  Then made we good our promise to them; and we delivered them and whom we pleased, and we destroyed the transgressors
  And now have we sent down to you "the book," in which is your warning: What, will ye not then understand?  And how many a guilty city have we broken down, and raised up after it other peoples:  And when they felt our vengeance, lo! they fled from it
  "Flee not," said the angels in mockery, "but come back to that wherein ye revelled, and to your abodes! Questions will haply be put to you
"  They said, "Oh, woe to us! Verily we have been evil doers
"  And this ceased not to be their cry, until we made them like reaped corn, extinct
  We created not the heaven and the earth, and what is between them, for sport:  Had it been our wish to find a pastime, we had surely found it in ourselves;- if to do so had been our will
  Nay, we will hurl the truth at falsehood, and it shall smite it, and lo! it shall vanish
 But woe be to you for what ye utter of God!  All beings in the heaven and on the earth are His: and they who are in his presence disdain not his service, neither are they wearied:  They praise Him night and day: they rest not
3  Have they taken gods from the earth who can quicken the dead?  Had there been in either heaven or earth gods besides God, both surely had gone to ruin
 But glory be to God, the Lord of the throne, beyond what they utter!  He shall not be asked of his doings, but they shall be asked
  Have they taken other gods beside Him? SAY; Bring forth your proofs that they are gods
 This is the warning of those who are with me, and the warning of those who were before me: but most of them know not the truth, and turn aside
  No apostle have we sent before thee to whom we did not reveal that "Verily there is no God beside me: therefore worship me
"  Yet they say, "The God of Mercy hath begotten issue from the angels
" Glory be to Him! Nay, they are but His honoured servants:  They speak not till He hath spoken;4 and they do His bidding
  He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them; and no plea shall they offer  Save for whom He pleaseth; and they tremble for fear of Him
  And that angel among them who saith "I am a god beside Him," will we recompense with hell: in such sort will we recompense the offenders
  Do not the infidels see that the heavens and the earth were both a solid mass, and that we clave them asunder, and that by means of water we give life to everything? Will they not then believe?  And we set mountains on the earth lest it should move with them, and we made on it broad passages between them as routes for their guidance;  And we made the heaven a roof strongly upholden; yet turn they away from its signs
  And He it is who hath created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each moving swiftly in its sphere
  At no time5 have we granted to man a life that shall last for ever: if thou then die, shall they live for ever?  Every soul shall taste of death:6 and for trial will we prove you with evil and with good; and unto Us shall ye be brought back
  And when the infidels see thee they receive thee only with scoffs:-"What! is this he who maketh such mention of your gods?" Yet when mention is made to them of the God of Mercy, they believe not
  "Man," say they, "is made up of haste
"7 But I will shew you my signs:8 desire them not then to be hastened
  They say, "When will this threat be made good? Tell us, if ye be men of truth?"  Did the infidels but know the time when they shall not be able to keep the fire of hell from their faces or from their backs, neither shall they be helped!  But it shall come on them suddenly and shall confound them; and they shall not be able to put it back, neither shall they be respited
  Other apostles have been scoffed at before thee: but that doom at which they mocked encompassed the scoffers
  SAY: Who shall protect you by night and by day from the God of Mercy? Yet turn they away from the warning of their Lord
  Have they gods beside Us who can defend them? For their own succour have they no power; neither shall the gods they join with God screen them from Us
  Yes! we have given these men and their fathers enjoyments so long as their life lasted
 What! see they not that we come to a land and straiten its borders9 Is it they who are the conquerors?  SAY: I only warn you of what hath been revealed to me: but the deaf will not hear the call, whenever they are warned;  Yet if a breath of thy Lord's chastisement touch them, they will assuredly say, "Oh! woe to us! we have indeed been offenders
"  Just balances will we set up for the day of the resurrection, neither shall any soul be wronged in aught; though, were a work but the weight of a grain of mustard seed, we would bring it forth to be weighed: and our reckoning will suffice
  We gave of old to Moses and Aaron the illumination,10 and a light and a warning for the God-fearing,  Who dread their Lord in secret, and who tremble for "the Hour
"  And this Koran which we have sent down is a blessed warning: will ye then disown it?  Of old we gave unto Abraham his direction,11 for we knew him worthy
  When he said to his Father and to his people, "What are these images to which ye are devoted?"  They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them
"  He said, "Truly ye and your fathers have been in a plain mistake
"  They said, "Hast thou come unto us in earnest? or art thou of those who jest?"  He said, "Nay, your Lord is Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, who hath created them both; and to this am I one of those who witness:  -And, by God, I will certainly lay a plot against your idols, after ye shall have retired and turned your backs
"  So, he broke them all in pieces, except the chief of them, that to it they might return, inquiring
  They said, "Who hath done this to our gods? Verily he is one of the unjust
"  They said, "We heard a youth make mention of them: they call him Abraham
"  They said, "Then bring him before the people's eyes, that they may witness against him
"  They said, "Hast thou done this to our gods, O Abraham?"  He said, "Nay, that their chief hath done it: but ask ye them, if they can speak
"  So they turned their thoughts upon themselves, and said, "Ye truly are the impious persons:"  Then became headstrong in their former error12 and exclaimed,"Thou knowest that these speak not
"  He said, "What! do ye then worship, instead of God, that which doth not profit you at all, nor injure you? Fie on you and on that ye worship instead of God! What! do ye not then understand?"  They said:13 "Burn him, and come to the succour of your gods: if ye will do anything at all
"  We said, "O fire! be thou cold, and to Abraham a safety!"14  And they sought to lay a plot against him, but we made them the sufferers
  And we brought him and Lot in safety to the land which we have blessed for all human beings:  And we gave him Isaac and Jacob as a farther gift, and we made all of them righteous:  We also made them models who should guide others by our command, and we inspired them with good deeds and constancy in prayer and almsgiving, and they worshipped us
  And unto Lot we gave wisdom, and knowledge; and we rescued him from the city which wrought filthiness; for they were a people, evil, perverse:  And we caused him to enter into our mercy, for he was of the righteous
  And remember Noah when aforetime he cried to us and we heard him, and delivered him and his family from the great calamity;  And we helped him against the people who treated our signs as impostures
 An evil people verily were they, and we drowned them all
  And David and Solomon; when they gave judgment concerning a field when some people's sheep had caused a waste therein; and we were witnesses of their judgment
  And we gave Solomon insight into the affair; and on both of them we bestowed wisdom and knowledge
 And we constrained the mountains and the birds to join with David in our praise: Our doing was it!  And we taught David the art of making mail15 for you, to defend you from each other's violence: will ye therefore be thankful?  And to Solomon we subjected we subjected the strongly blowing wind; it sped at his bidding to the land we had blessed; for we know all things:  And sundry Satans16 who should dive for him and perform other work beside: and we kept watch over them
  And remember Job: When he cried to his Lord, "Truly evil hath touched me: but thou art the most merciful of those who shew mercy
"  So we heard him, and lightened the burden of his woe; and we gave him back his family, and as many more with them,-a mercy from us, and a memorial for those who serve us:  And Ismael, and Edris17 and Dhoulkefl18-all steadfast in patience
  And we caused them to enter into our mercy; for they were of the righteous:  And Dhoulnoun;19 when he went on his way in anger, and thought that we had no power over him
 But in the darkness he cried "There is no God but thou: Glory be unto Thee! Verily, I have been one of the evil doers:"  So we heard him and rescued him from misery: for thus rescue we the faithful:  And Zacharias; when he called upon his Lord saying, "O my Lord, leave me not childless: but there is no better heir than Thyself
"20  So we heard him, and gave him John, and we made his wife fit for child- bearing
 Verily, these vied in goodness, and called upon us with love and fear, and humbled themselves before us:  And her who kept her maidenhood, and into whom21 we breathed of our spirit, and made her and her son a sign to all creatures
  Of a truth, this, your religion, is the one22 Religion, and I your Lord; therefore serve me:  But they have rent asunder this their great concern among themselves into sects
 All of them shall return to us
  And whoso shall do the things that are right, and be a believer, his efforts shall not be disowned: and surely will we write them down for him
  There is a ban on every city which we shall have destroyed, that they shall not rise again,  Until a way is opened for Gog and Magog,23 and they shall hasten from every high land,  And this sure promise shall draw on
 And lo! the eyes of the infidels shall stare amazedly; and they shall say, "Oh, our misery! of this were we careless! yea, we were impious persons
"  Verily, ye, and what ye worship beside God,24 shall be fuel for hell: ye shall go down into it
  Were these gods, they would not go down into it; but they shall all abide in it for ever
  Therein shall they groan; but nought therein shall they hear to comfort them
  But they for whom we have before ordained good things, shall be far away from it:  Its slightest sound they shall not hear: in what their souls longed for, they shall abide for ever:  The great terror shall not trouble them; and the angel shall meet them with, "This is your day which ye were promised
"  On that day we will roll up the heaven as one rolleth up25 written scrolls
 As we made the first creation, so will we bring it forth again
 This promise bindeth us; verily, we will perform it
  And now, since the Law was given, have we written in the Psalms that "my servants, the righteous, shall inherit the earth
"26  Verily, in this Koran is teaching for those who serve God
  We have not sent thee otherwise than as mercy unto all creatures
  SAY: Verily it hath been revealed to me that your God is one God; are ye then resigned to Him? (Muslims
)  But if they turn their backs, then SAY: I have warned you all alike; but I know not whether that with which ye are threatened be nigh or distant
  God truly knoweth what is spoken aloud, and He also knoweth that which ye hide
  And I know not whether haply this delay be not for your trial, and that ye may enjoy yourselves for a time
  My Lord saith: Judge ye with truth; for our Lord is the God of Mercy-whose help is to be sought against what ye utter

-AL FURKAN [LXVI
]  MECCA
-77 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  BLESSED be He who hath sent down AL FURKAN1 (the illumination) on his servant, that to all creatures he may be a warner
  His the Kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! No son hath He begotten! No partner hath He in his Empire! All things hath He created, and decreeing hath decreed their destinies
  Yet have they adopted gods beside Him which have created nothing, but were themselves created:  And no power have they over themselves for evil or for good, nor have they power of death, or of life, or of raising the dead
  And the infidels say, "This Koran is a mere fraud of his own devising, and others have helped him with it,2 who had come hither by outrage and lie
"3  And they say, "Tales of the ancients that he hath put in writing! and they were dictated to him morn and even
"  SAY: He hath sent it down who knoweth the secrets of the Heavens and of the Earth
 He truly is the Gracious, the Merciful
  And they say, "What sort of apostle is this? He eateth food and he walketh the streets! Unless an angel be sent down and take part in his warnings,  Or a treasure be thrown down to him, or he have a garden that supplieth him with food 
 
 
"4 and those unjust persons say, "Ye follow but a man enchanted
"  See what likenesses they strike out for thee! But they err, and cannot find their way
  Blessed be He who if he please can give thee better than that of which they speak-Gardens, 'neath which the rivers flow: and pavilions will He assign thee
  Aye, they have treated the coming of "the Hour" as a lie
 But a flaming fire have we got ready for those who treat the coming of the Hour as a lie
  When it shall see them from afar, they shall hear its raging and roaring,-  And when they shall be flung into a narrow space thereof bound together, they shall invoke destruction on the spot:  -"Call not this day for one destruction, but call for destructions many
"  SAY: Is this, or the Paradise of Eternity which was promised to the God- fearing, best? Their recompense shall it be and their retreat;  Abiding therein for ever, they shall have in it all that they desire! It is a promise to be claimed of thy Lord
  And on the day when he shall gather them together, and those whom they worshipped beside God, he will say, "Was it ye who led these my servants astray, or of themselves strayed they from the path?"  They will say, "Glory be to thee! It beseemed not us to take other lords than thee
 But thou gavest them and their fathers their fill of good things, till they forgat the remembrance of thee, and became a lost people
"  Then will God say to the Idolaters, "Now have they made you liars in what ye say,5 and they have no power to avert your doom, or to succour you
"  And whosoever of you thus offendeth, we will make him taste a great punishment
  Never have we sent Apostles before thee who ate not common food, and walked not the streets
 And we test you by means of each other
 Will ye be steadfast? Thy Lord is looking on!  They who look not forward to meet Us say, "If the angels be not sent down to us, or unless we behold our Lord
 
 
 
”  Ah! they are proud of heart, and exceed with great excess!  On the day when they shall see the angels, no good news shall there be for the guilty ones, and they shall cry out, "A barrier that cannot be passed!"6  Then will we proceed to the works which they have wrought, and make them as scattered dust
  Happier, on that day, the inmates of the Garden as to abode, and better off as to place of noontide slumber!  On that day shall the heaven with its clouds be cleft, and the angels shall be sent down, descending:  On that day shall all empire be in very deed with the God of Mercy, and a hard day shall it be for the Infidels
  And on that day shall the wicked one7 bite his hands, and say, "Oh! would that I had taken the same path with the Apostle!  "Oh! woe is me! would that I had not taken such an one8 for my friend!  It was he who led me astray from the Warning which had reached me! and Satan is man's betrayer
"9  Then said the Apostle, "O my Lord! truly my people have esteemed this Koran to be vain babbling
"  Thus have we given to every Prophet an enemy from among the wicked ones-But thy Lord is a sufficient guide and helper
  And the infidels say, "Unless the Koran be sent down to him all at once
 
 
 
" But in this way would we stablish thy heart by it; in parcels have we parcelled it out to thee;10  Nor shall they come to thee with puzzling questions,11 but we will come to thee with the truth, and their best solution
  They who shall be gathered upon their faces into hell, shall have the worst place, and be farthest from the path of happiness
  Heretofore we gave the law to Moses, and appointed his brother Aaron to be his counsellor:12  And we said, "Go ye to the people who treat our signs as lies
" And them destroyed we with utter destruction
  And as to the people of Noah! when they treated their Apostles as impostors, we drowned them; and we made them a sign to mankind:-A grievous chastisement have we prepared for the wicked!  And Ad and Themoud, and the men of Rass,13 and divers generations between them:  Unto each of them did we set forth parables for warnings, and each of them did we utterly exterminate
  Oft are this have the unbelieving Meccans passed by the city on which was rained a fatal rain
 What! Have they not seen it? Yet have they no hope of a resurrection!  And when they see thee, they do but take thee as the subject of their railleries
 "What! Is this he whom God has sent as an Apostle?  Indeed he had well nigh led us astray from our gods, had we not persevered steadfastly in their service
" But in the end they shall know, when they shall see the punishment, who hath most strayed from the path
  What thinkest thou? He who hath taken his passions as a god-wilt thou be a guardian over him?  Thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or understand? They are just like the brutes! Yes! they stray even further from the right way
  Hast thou not seen how thy Lord lengtheneth out the shadow?14 Had He pleased he had made it motionless
15 But we made the sun to be its guide;  Then draw it in unto Us with easy indrawing
  He it is who ordaineth the night as a garment, and sleep for rest, and ordaineth the day for waking up to life:  He it is who sendeth the winds as the forerunner of his mercy (rain); and pure water send we down from Heaven,  That we may revive by it a dead land: and we give it for drink to our creation, beasts and men in numbers;  And we distribute it among them on all sides, that they may reflect: but most men refuse to be aught but thankless
  Had we pleased, we had raised up a warner in every city
  Give not way therefore to the Infidels, but by means of this Koran strive against them with a mighty strife
  And He it is who hath let loose the two seas,16 the one sweet, fresh; and the other salt, bitter; and hath put an interspace between them, and a barrier that cannot be passed
  And it is He who hath created man of water,17 and established between them the ties of kindred and affinity: and potent is thy Lord
  Yet beside God do they worship what can neither help nor hurt them: and the Infidel is Satan's helper against his Lord:  Still we have sent thee only as a herald and a warner
  SAY: I ask of you no recompense for it,18 except from him who is willing to take the way to his Lord
  And put thou thy trust in Him that liveth and dieth not, and celebrate his praise; (He fully knoweth the faults of his servants) who in six days created the Heavens and the Earth, and whatever is between them, then mounted his Throne: the God of Mercy! Ask now of the Wise concerning Him
  But when it is said to them, "Bow down before the God of Mercy," they say, "Who is the God of Mercy? Shall we bow down to what thou biddest?" And they fly from thee the more
  Blessed be He who hath placed in the Heaven the sign of the Zodiac!19 who hath placed in it the Lamp of the Sun, and the light-giving Moon!  And it is He who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed one another for those who desire to think on God or desire to be thankful
  And the servants of the God of Mercy are they who walk upon the Earth softly; and when the ignorant20 address them, they reply, "Peace!"  They that pass the night in the worship of their lord prostrate and standing:-  And that say, "O our Lord! turn away from us the torment of Hell, for its torment is endless: it is indeed an ill abode and resting place!  Those who when they spend are neither lavish nor niggard, but keep the mean:-  Those who call on no other gods with God, nor slay whom God hath forbidden to be slain, except for a just cause, and who commit not fornication (for he who doth this shall meet the reward of his wickedness:  Doubled to him shall be the torment on the day of Resurrection; and in it shall he remain, disgraced, for ever:-  Save those who shall repent and believe and do righteous works-for them God will change their evil things into good things, for God is Gracious, Merciful-  And whose turneth to God and doeth what is right, he verily will convert with a true conversion):  And they who bear not witness to that which is false, and when they pass by frivolous sport, pass on with dignity:-  And they who, when monished by the signs of their Lord, fall not down thereat, as if deaf and blind:-  And who say, "O our Lord! give us in our wives and offspring the joy of our eyes, and make us examples to those who fear thee:"  These shall be rewarded with the High Places of Paradise for their steadfast endurance, and they shall meet therein with-Welcome and Salutation:-  For ever shall they remain therein: a fair abode and resting-place!  SAY: Not on your account doth my Lord care if ye call not on Him! ye have treated his Apostle as an impostor: but bye and bye a punishment shall cleave to them

  And4 we gave the Book to Moses and ordained it for guidance to the children of Israel-"that ye take no other Guardian than me
"  O posterity of those whom we bare with Noah! He truly was a grateful servant!  And we solemnly declared to the children of Israel in the Book, "Twice surely will ye enact crimes in the earth, and with great loftiness of pride will ye surely be uplifted
"  So when the menace for the first crime5 came to be inflicted, we sent against you our servants endued with terrible prowess; and they searched the inmost part of your abodes, and the menace was accomplished
  Then we gave you the mastery over them6 in turn, and increased you in wealth and children, and made you a most numerous host
  We said, "If ye do well, to your own behoof will ye do well: and if ye do evil, against yourselves will ye do it
 And when the menace for your latter crime7 came to be inflicted, then we sent an enemy to sadden your faces, and to enter the temple as they entered it at first, and to destroy with utter destruction that which they had conquered
  Haply your Lord will have mercy on you! but if ye return, we will return:8 and we have appointed Hell-the prison of the infidels
  Verily, this Koran guideth to what is most upright; and it announceth to believers  Who do the things that are right, that for them is a great reward;  And that for those who believe not in the life to come, we have got ready a painful punishment
  Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man is hasty
  We have made the night and the day for two signs: the sign of the night do we obscure, but the sign of the day cause we to shine forth, that ye may seek plenty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number of the years and the reckoning of time; and we have made everything distinct by distinctiveness
  And every man's fate9 have we fastened about his neck: and on the day of resurrection will we bring forth to him a book which shall be proffered to him wide open:  -"Read thy Book:10 there needeth none but thyself to make out an account against thee this day
"  For his own good only shall the guided yield to guidance, and to his own loss only shall the erring err; and the heavy laden shall not be laden with another's load
 We never punished until we had first sent an apostle:  And when we willed to destroy a city, to its affluent ones did we address our bidding; but when they acted criminally therein, just was its doom, and we destroyed it with an utter destruction
  And since Noah, how many nations have we exterminated! And of the sins of his servants thy Lord is sufficiently informed, observant
  Whoso chooseth this quickly passing life, quickly will we bestow therein that which we please-even on him we choose; afterward we will appoint hell for him, in which he shall burn-disgraced, outcast:  But whoso chooseth the next life, and striveth after it as it should be striven for, being also a believer,-these! their striving shall be grateful to God:  To all-both to these and those-will we prolong the gifts of thy Lord; for not to any shall the gifts of thy Lord be denied
  See how we have caused some of them to excel others! but the next life shall be greater in its grades, and greater in excellence
  Set not up another god with God, lest thou sit thee down disgraced, helpless
11  Thy Lord hath ordained that ye worship none but him; and, kindness to your parents, whether one or both of them attain to old age with thee: and say not to them, "Fie!" neither reproach them; but speak to them both with respectful speech;  And defer humbly to them12 out of tenderness; and say, "Lord, have compassion on them both, even as they reared me when I was little
"  Your Lord well knoweth what is in your souls; he knoweth whether ye be righteous:  And gracious is He to those who return to Him
  And to him who is of kin render his due, and also to the poor and to the wayfarer; yet waste not wastefully,  For the wasteful are brethren of the Satans, and Satan was ungrateful to his Lord:  But if thou turn away from them, while thou thyself seekest boons from thy Lord for which thou hopest, at least speak to them with kindly speech:  And let not thy hand be tied up to thy neck; nor yet open it with all openness, lest thou sit thee down in rebuke, in beggary
  Verily, thy Lord will provide with open hand for whom he pleaseth, and will be sparing
 His servants doth he scan, inspect
  Kill not your children for fear of want:13 for them and for you will we provide
 Verily, the killing them is a great wickedness
  Have nought to do with adultery; for it is a foul thing and an evil way:  Neither slay any one whom God hath forbidden you to slay, unless for a just cause: and whosoever shall be slain wrongfully, to his heir14 have we given powers; but let him not outstep bounds in putting the manslayer to death, for he too, in his turn, will be assisted and avenged
  And touch not the substance of the orphan, unless in an upright way, till he attain his age of strength: And perform your covenant; verily the covenant shall be enquired of:  And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with just balance
 This will be better, and fairest for settlement:  And follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge;15 because the hearing and the sight and the heart,-each of these shall be enquired of:  And walk not proudly on the earth, for thou canst not cleave the earth, neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height:  All this is evil; odious to thy Lord
  This is a part of the wisdom which thy Lord hath revealed to thee
 Set not up any other god with God, lest thou be cast into Hell, rebuked, cast away
  What! hath your Lord prepared sons for you, and taken for himself daughters from among the angels? Indeed, ye say a dreadful saying
  Moreover, for man's warning have we varied16 this Koran: Yet it only increaseth their flight from it
  SAY: If, as ye affirm, there were other gods with Him, they would in that case seek occasion against the occupant of the throne:  Glory to Him! Immensely high is He exalted above their blasphemies!  The seven heavens17 praise him, and the earth, and all who are therein; neither is there aught which doth not celebrate his praise; but their utterances of praise ye understand not
 He is kind, indulgent
  When thou recitest the Koran we place between thee and those who believe not in the life to come, a dark veil;  And we put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it, and in their ears a heaviness;  And when in the Koran thou namest thy One Lord, they turn their backs in flight
  We well know why they hearken, when they hearken unto thee, and when they whisper apart; when the wicked say, "Ye follow no other than a man enchanted
"  See what likenesses they strike out for thee! But they are in error, neither can they find the path
  They also say, "After we shall have become bones and dust, shall we in sooth be raised a new creation?"  SAY: "Yes, though ye were stones, or iron, or any other creature, to your seeming, yet harder to be raised
" But they will say, "Who shall bring us back?" SAY: "He who created you at first
" And they will wag their heads at thee, and say, "When shall this be?" SAY: "Haply it is nigh
"  On that day shall God call you forth, and ye shall answer by praising Him; and ye shall seem to have tarried but a little while
  Enjoin my servants to speak in kindly sort: Verily Satan would stir up strifes among them, for Satan is man's avowed foe
  Your Lord well knoweth you: if He please He will have mercy on you; or if He please He will chastise you: and we have not sent thee to be a guardian over them
  Thy Lord hath full knowledge of all in the heavens and the earth
 Higher gifts have we given to some of the prophets than to others, and the Psalter we gave to David
  SAY: Call ye upon those whom ye fancy to be gods beside Him; yet they will have no power to relieve you from trouble, or to shift it elsewhere
  Those whom ye call on, themselves desire union with their Lord,18 striving which of them shall be nearest to him: they also hope for his mercy and fear his chastisement
 Verily the chastisement of thy Lord is to be dreaded
  There is no city which we will not destroy before the day of Resurrection, or chastise it with a grievous chastisement
 This is written in the Book
  Nothing hindered us from sending thee with the power of working miracles, except that the peoples of old treated them as lies
 We gave to Themoud19 the she-camel before their very eyes, yet they maltreated her! We send not a prophet with miracles but to strike terror
  And remember when we said to thee, Verily, thy Lord is round about mankind; we ordained the vision20 which we shewed thee, and likewise the cursed tree of the Koran, only for men to dispute of; we will strike them with terror; but it shall only increase in them enormous wickedness:  And when we said to the Angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam:" and they all prostrated them, save Eblis
 "What!" said he, "shall I bow me before him whom thou hast created of clay?  Seest thou this man whom thou hast honoured above me? Verily, if thou respite me till the day of Resurrection, I will destroy his offspring, except a few
"  He said, "Begone; but whosoever of them shall follow thee, verily, Hell shall be your recompense; an ample recompense!  And entice such of them as thou canst by thy voice; assault them with thy horsemen and thy footmen;21 be their partner in their riches and in their children, and make them promises: but Satan shall make them only deceitful promises
  As to my servants, no power over them shalt thou have; And thy Lord will be their sufficient guardian
"  It is your Lord who speedeth onward the ships for you in the sea, that ye may seek of his abundance; for he is merciful towards you
  When a misfortune befalleth you out at sea, they whom ye invoke are not to be found: God alone is there: yet when he bringeth you safe to dry land, ye place yourselves at a distance from Him
 Ungrateful is man
  What! are ye sure, then, that he will not cleave the sides of the earth for you? or that he will not send against you a whirlwind charged with sands? Then shall ye find no protector
  Or are ye sure that he will not cause you to put back to sea a second time, and send against you a storm blast, and drown you, for that ye have been thankless? Then shall ye find no helper against us therein
  And now have we honoured the children of Adam: by land and by sea have we carried them: food have we provided for them of good things, and with endowments beyond many of our creatures have we endowed them
  One day we will summon all men with their leaders: they whose book shall be given into their right hand, shall read their book, and not be wronged a thread:  And he who has been blind here, shall be blind hereafter, and wander yet more from the way
  And, verily, they had well nigh beguiled thee from what we revealed to thee, and caused thee to invent some other thing in our name: but in that case they would surely have taken thee as a friend;22  And had we not settled thee, thou hadst well nigh leaned to them a little:  In that case we would surely have made thee taste of woe23 in life and of woe in death: then thou shouldest not have found a helper against us
  And truly they had almost caused thee to quit the land, in order wholly to drive thee forth from it:24 but then, themselves should have tarried but a little after thee
  This was our way with the Apostles we have already sent before thee, and in this our way thou shalt find no change
  Observe prayer at sunset, till the first darkening of the night, and the daybreak reading-for the daybreak reading hath its witnesses,  And watch unto it in the night: this shall be an excess in service:25 it may be that thy Lord will raise thee to a glorious station:  And say, "O my Lord, cause me to enter26 with a perfect entry, and to come forth with a perfect forthcoming, and give me from thy presence a helping power:"  And SAY: Truth is come and falsehood is vanished
 Verily, falsehood is a thing that vanisheth
  And we send down of the Koran that which is a healing and a mercy to the faithful: But it shall only add to the ruin of the wicked
  When we bestow favours on man, he withdraweth and goeth aside; but when evil toucheth him, he is despairing
  SAY: Every one acteth after his own manner: but your Lord well knoweth who is best guided in his path
  And they will ask thee of the Spirit
27 SAY: The Spirit proceedeth at my Lord's command: but of knowledge, only a little to you is given
  If we pleased, we could take away what we have revealed to thee: none couldst thou then find thee to undertake thy cause with us,  Save as a mercy from thy Lord; great, verily, is his favour towards thee
  SAY: Verily, were men and Djinn assembled to produce the like of this Koran, they could not produce its like, though the one should help the other
  And of a truth we have set out to men every kind of similitude in this Koran, but most men have refused everything except unbelief
  And they say, "By no means will we believe on thee till thou cause a fountain to gush forth for us from the earth;  Or, till thou have a garden of palm-trees and grapes, and thou cause forth- gushing rivers to gush forth in its midst;  Or thou make the heaven to fall on us, as thou hast given out, in pieces; or thou bring God and the angels to vouch for thee;  Or thou have a house of gold; or thou mount up into Heaven; nor will we believe in thy mounting up, till thou send down to us a book which we may read
" SAY: Praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?  And what hindereth men from believing, when the guidance hath come to them, but that they say, "Hath God sent a man as an apostle?"  SAY: Did angels walk the earth as its familiars, we had surely sent them an angel-apostle out of Heaven
  SAY: God is witness enough between you and me
 His servants He scanneth, eyeth
  And He whom God shall guide will be guided indeed; and whom he shall mislead thou shalt find none to assist, but Him: and we will gather them together on the day of the resurrection, on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf: Hell shall be their abode: so oft as its fires die down, we will rekindle the flame
  This shall be their reward for that they believed not our signs and said, "When we shall have become bones and dust, shall we surely be raised a new creation?"  Do they not perceive that God, who created the Heavens and the Earth, is able to create their like? And he hath ordained them a term; there is no doubt of it: but the wicked refuse everything except unbelief
  SAY: If ye held the treasures of my Lord's mercy ye would certainly refrain from them through fear of spending them: for man is covetous
  We therefore gave to Moses nine clear signs
 Ask thou, therefore, the children of Israel how it was when he came unto them, and Pharaoh said to him, "Verily, I deem thee, O Moses, a man enchanted
"  Said Moses, "Thou knowest that none hath sent down these clear signs but the Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth; and I surely deem thee, O Pharaoh, a person lost
"  So Pharaoh sought to drive them out of the land; but we drowned him and all his followers
  And after his death, we said to the children of Israel, "Dwell ye in the land:" and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass, we will bring you both up together to judgment
 In truth have we sent down the Koran, and in truth hath it descended, and we have only sent thee to announce and to warn
  And we have parcelled out the Koran into sections, that thou mightest recite it unto men by slow degrees, and we have sent it down piecemeal
  SAY: Believe ye therein or believe ye not? They verily to whom knowledge had been given previously, fall on their faces worshipping when it is recited to them, and say: "Glory be to God! the promise of our Lord is made good!"  They fall down on their faces weeping, and It increaseth their humility
  SAY: Call upon God (Allah),28 or call upon the God of Mercy (Arrahman), by whichsoever ye will invoke him: He hath most excellent names
 And be not loud in thy prayer, neither pronounce it too low;29 but between these follow a middle way:  And SAY: Praise be to God who hath not begotten a son, who hath no partner in the Kingdom, nor any protector on account of weakness
 And magnify him by proclaiming His greatness

   SURA XXVII
-THE ANT [LXVIII
]  MECCA
-95 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  TA
 SAD
1 These are the signs (verses) of the Koran and of the lucid Book;  Guidance and glad tidings to the believers who observe prayer and pay the stated alms, and believe firmly-do they-in the life to come
  As to those who believe not in the life to come, we have made their own doings fair seeming to them, and they are bewildered therein
  These are they whom the woe of chastisement awaiteth; and in the next life they shall suffer-yes shall they-greatest loss;  But thou hast certainly received the Koran from the Wise, the Knowing
  Bear in mind when Moses said to his family, "I have perceived a fire;  I will bring you tidings from it, or will bring you a blazing brand, that ye may warm you
"  And when he came to it, he was called to, "Blessed, He who is in the fire, and He who is about it; and glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds!  O Moses! verily, I am God, the Mighty, the Wise!  Throw down now thy staff
" And when he saw that it moved itself as though it were a serpent, he retreated backward and returned not
 "O Moses, fear not; for the Sent Ones fear not in my presence,  Save he who having done amiss shall afterwards exchange the evil for good; for I am Forgiving, Merciful
  Put now thy hand into thy bosom: it shall come forth white, yet free from hurt:2 one of nine signs to Pharaoh and his people; for a perverse people are they
"  And when our signs were wrought in their very sight,3 they said, "This is plain magic
"  And though in their souls they knew them to be true, yet in their wickedness and pride they denied them
 But see what was the end of the corrupt doers!  And of old we gave knowledge to David and Solomon: and they said, "Praise be to God, who hath made us to excel many of his believing servants!"  And in knowledge Solomon was David's heir
 And he said, "O men, we have been taught the speech of birds,4 and are endued with everything
 This is indeed a clear boon from God
"  And to Solomon were gathered his hosts of Djinn5 and men and birds, and they were marched on in bands,  Till they reached the Valley of Ants
 Said AN ANT, "O ye ants, enter your dwellings, lest Solomon and his army crush you and know it not
"  Then smiled Solomon, laughing at her words, and he said, "Stir me up, O Lord, to be thankful for thy favour which thou hast shewed upon me and upon my parents, and to do righteousness that shall be well pleasing to thee, and bring me in, by thy mercy, among thy servants the righteous
"  And he reviewed the birds, and said, "How is it that I see not the lapwing? Is it one of the absent?  Surely, with a severe chastisement will I chastise it, or I will certainly slaughter it, unless it bring me a clear excuse
"  Nor tarried it long ere it came and said, "I have gained the knowledge that thou knowest not, and with sure tidings have I come to thee from Saba:  I found a woman reigning over them, gifted with everything, and she hath a splendid throne;  And I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of God; and Satan hath made their works fair seeming to them, so that he hath turned them from the Way: wherefore they are not guided,  To the worship of God, who bringeth to light the secret things of heaven and earth, and knoweth what men conceal and what they manifest:  God! there is no god but He! the lord of the glorious throne!"  He said, "We shall see whether thou hast spoken truth, or whether thou art of them that lie
  Go with this my letter and throw it down to them: then turn away from them and await their answer
"  She said, "O my nobles! an honourable letter hath been thrown down to me:  It is from Solomon; and it is this: 'In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful!  Set not up yourselves against me, but come to me submitting (Muslims)
' "  She said, "O my nobles, advise me in mine affair: I decide it not without your concurrence
"6  They said, "We are endued with strength and are endued with mighty valour
- But to command is thine: See therefore what thou wilt command us
"  She said, "Kings when they enter a city spoil it, and abase the mightiest of its people: and in like manner will these also do
  But I will send to them with a gift, and await what my envoys bring back
"  And when the messenger came to Solomon, he said, "Aid ye me with riches? But what God hath given to me is better than what he hath given you: yet ye glory in your gifts:  Return to them: for we will surely come to them with forces which they cannot withstand, and we will drive them from their land humbled and contemptible
"  Said he, "O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me, submitting? (Muslims)
"  An Efreet7 of the Djinn said: "I will bring it thee ere thou risest from thy place: I have power for this and am trusty
"  And one who had the knowledge of Scripture said, "I will bring it to thee in the twinkling of an eye
"8 And when he saw it set before him, he said, "This is of the favour of my Lord, to try me whether I will be thankful or unthankful
 And he who is thankful is thankful to his own behoof; and as for him who is unthankful-truly my Lord is self-sufficient, bounteous!"  Said he, "Make her throne so that she know it not: we shall see whether she hath or not guidance
"  And when she came he said, "Is thy throne like this?" She said, "As though it were the same
" "And we," said he, "have had knowledge given us before her, and have been Muslims
"  But the gods she had worshipped instead of God had led her astray: for she was of a people who believe not
  It was said to her,"Enter the Palace:" and when she saw it, she thought it a lake of water, and bared her legs
 He said, "It is a palace paved with glass
"  She said, "O my Lord! I have sinned against my own soul, and I resign myself, with Solomon, to God the Lord of the Worlds
"  And of old we sent to Themoud their brother Saleh, with "Serve ye God:"but lo! they became two sets of disputants wrangling with each other
  He said, "O my people, why, if ye ask not pardon of God that ye may find mercy, hasten ye on evil rather than good?"  They said,"We augur9 ill concerning thee and those who are with thee
" He said, "The ills of which ye augur10 depend on God
 But ye are a people on your trial
"  And there were in the city nine persons who committed excesses in the land and did not that which is right
  They said, "Swear ye to one another by God that we will surely fall on him and on his family by night: then will be say to the avenger of blood, we witnessed not the destruction of his family: and verily we speak the truth
"  And they devised a device, and we devised a device, and they were not aware of it-  And see what was the end of their device! We destroyed them and their whole people:  And for their sin these their houses are empty ruins: Verily in this is a sign to those who understand;  And we delivered those who believed and feared
  And Lot, when he said to his people, "What! proceed ye to such filthiness with your eyes open?  What! come ye with lust unto men rather than to women? Surely ye are an ignorant people
"  And the answer of his people was but to say, "Cast out the family of Lot from your city: they, forsooth, are men of purity!"  So we rescued him and his family: but as for his wife, we decreed her to be of them that lingered:  And we rained a rain upon them, and fatal was the rain to those who had had their warning
  SAY: Praise be to God and peace be on His servants whom He hath chosen! Is God the more worthy or the gods they join with Him?  Is not He who hath made the Heavens and the Earth, and hath sent down rain to you from Heaven, by which we cause the luxuriant groves to spring up! It is not in your power to cause its trees to spring up! What! A god with God? Yet they find equals for Him!  Is not He, who hath set the earth so firm, and hath made rivers in its midst, and hath placed mountains upon it, and put a barrier between the two seas?11 What! a god with God? Yet the greater part of them have no knowledge!  Is not He the more worthy who answereth the oppressed when they cry to him, and taketh off their ills, and maketh you to succeed your sires on the earth? What! a god with God? How few bear these things in mind!  Is not He, who guideth you in the darkness of the land and of the sea, and who sendeth forth the winds as the forerunners of His mercy? What! a god with God? Far from God be what ye join with Him!  Is not He, who created a Being, then reneweth it, and who supplieth you out of the Heaven and the Earth? What! a god with God? SAY: Bring forth your proofs if you speak the truth
  SAY: None either in the Heavens or in the Earth knoweth the unseen but God
 And they know not  When they shall be raised
  -Yet they have attained to a knowledge of the life to come:12-yet are they in doubt about it:-yet are they blind about it!  And the unbelievers say: "When we and our fathers have been dead shall we be taken forth?  Of old have we been promised this, we and our sires of old it is but fables of the ancients
"  SAY: Go ye through the land, and see what hath been the end of the wicked
  And grieve not thou for them, nor be in distress at their devisings
  And they say, "When will this promise be made good, if ye speak true?"  SAY: Haply a part of what ye desire to be hastened may be close behind you
  And truly thy Lord is full of goodness towards men: But most of them are not thankful
  And thy Lord knoweth well what their breasts enshroud, and what they bring to light,  And there is no secret thing in the Heaven or on the Earth, but it is in the clear Book
  Truly this Koran declareth to the children of Israel most things wherein they disagree:  And it is certainly guidance and a mercy to the faithful
  Verily, by his wisdom will thy Lord decide between them: for He is the Mighty, the Knowing
  Put thou then thy trust in God: for thou hast clear truth on thy side
13  Thou shalt not make the dead to hear; neither shalt thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn away backward;  Neither art thou the guide of the blind out of their errors: none truly shalt thou make to hear but those who believe our signs: and they are Muslims
  When the doom shall be ready to light upon them, we will cause a monster14 to come forth to them out of the earth, and cry to them "Verily men have not firmly believed our signs
"  And on that day shall be gathered out of every nation a company of those who have gainsaid our signs, in separate bands;  Till they come before God, who will say, "Treated ye my signs as impostures, although ye embraced them not in your knowledge? or what is it that ye were doing?  And doom shall light upon them for their evil deeds, and nought shall they have to plead
  See they not that we have ordained the night that they may rest in it, and the day with its gift of light? Of a truth herein are signs to people who believe
  On that day there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and all that are in the heavens, and all that the on the earth shall be terror-stricken, save him whom God pleaseth to deliver; and all shall come to him in humble guise
  And thou shalt see the mountains, which thou thinkest so firm, pass away with the passing of a cloud! 'Tis the work of God, who ordereth all things! of all that ye do is He well aware
  To him who shall present himself with good works, shall be a reward beyond their desert,15 and they shall be secure from the terror on that day;  And they who shall present themselves with evil shall be flung downward on their faces into the fire
 Shall ye be rewarded but as ye have wrought?  SAY: Specially am I commanded to worship the Lord of this land, which He hath sanctified
 All things are His: and I am commanded to be one of those who surrender them to God (a Muslim)  And to recite the Koran: and whoever is rightly guided, assuredly will be rightly guided to his own behoof
  And as to him who erreth, SAY, I truly am a warner only
And SAY, Praise be to God! He will shew you His signs, and ye shall acknowledge them: and of what ye do, thy Lord is not regardless

-THE CAVE [LXIX
]  MECCA
-110 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  PRAISE be to God, who hath sent down the Book to his servant, and hath not made it tortuous1  But direct; that it may warn of a grievous woe from him, and announce to the faithful who do the things that are right, that a goodly reward, wherein they shall abide for ever, awaiteth them;  And that it may warn those who say, "God hath begotten a Son
"  No knowledge of this have either they or their fathers! A grievous saying to come out of their mouths! They speak no other than a lie!  And haply, if they believe not in this new revelation, thou wilt slay thyself, on their very footsteps, out of vexation
  Verily, we have made all that is on earth as its adornment, that we might make trial who among mankind would excel in works:  But we are surely about to reduce all that is thereon to dust!  Hast thou reflected that the Inmates of THE CAVE and of Al Rakim2 were on our wondrous signs?  When the youths betook them to the cave they said, "O our Lord! grant us mercy from before thee, and order for us our affair aright
"  Then struck we upon their ears with deafness in the cave for many a year:  Then we awaked them that we might know which of the two parties could best reckon the space of their abiding
  We will relate to thee their tale with truth
 They were youths who had believed in their Lord, and in guidance had we increased them;  And we had made them stout of heart, when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth: we will call on no other God than Him; for in that case we had said a thing outrageous
  These our people have taken other gods beside Him, though they bring no clear proof for them; but, who more iniquitous than he who forgeth a lie of God?  So when ye shall have separated you from them and from that which they worship beside God, then betake you to the cave: Your Lord will unfold his mercy to you, and will order your affairs for you for the best
"  And thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose, pass on the right of their cave, and when it set, leave them on the left, while they were in its spacious chamber
 This is one of the signs of God
 Guided indeed is he whom God guideth; but for him whom He misleadeth, thou shalt by no means find a patron, director
  And thou wouldst have deemed them awake,3 though they were sleeping: and we turned them to the right and to the left
 And in the entry lay their dog with paws outstretched
4 Hadst thou come suddenly upon them, thou wouldst surely have turned thy back on them in flight, and have been filled with fear at them
  So we awaked them that they might question one another
 Said one of them, "How long have ye tarried here?" They said, "We have tarried a day or part of day
" They said, "Your Lord knoweth best how long ye have tarried: Send now one of you with this your coin into the city, and let him mark who therein hath purest food, and from him let him bring you a supply: and let him be courteous, and not discover you to any one
  For they, if they find you out, will stone you or turn you back to their faith, and in that case it will fare ill with you for ever
"  And thus made we their adventure known to their fellow citizens, that they might learn that the promise of God is true, and that as to "the Hour" there is no doubt of its coming
 When they disputed among themselves concerning what had befallen them, some said, "Build a building over them; their Lord knoweth best about them
" Those who prevailed in the matter said, "A place of worship will we surely raise over them
"  Some say, "They were three; their dog the fourth:" others say, "Five; their dog the sixth," guessing at the secret: others say, "Seven; and their dog the eighth
" SAY: My Lord best knoweth the number: none, save a few, shall know them
  Therefore be clear in they discussions about them,5 and ask not any Christian concerning them
  Say not thou of a thing, " I will surely do it to-morrow;" without , "If God will
"6 And when thou hast forgotten, call thy Lord to mind; and say, "Haply my Lord will guide me, that I may come near to the truth of this story with correctness
"  And they tarried in their cave 300 years, and 9 years over
7  SAY: God best knoweth how long they tarried: With Him are the secrets of the Heavens and of the Earth: Look thou and hearken unto Him alone
8 Man hath no guardian but Him, and none may bear part in his judgments:-  And publish what hath been revealed to thee of the Book of thy Lord-none may change his words,-and thou shalt find no refuge beside Him
  Be patient with those who call upon their Lord at morn and even, seeking his face: and let not thine eyes be turned away from them in quest of the pomp of this life;9 neither obey him10 whose heart we have made careless of the remembrance of Us, and who followeth his own lusts, and whose ways are unbridled
  And SAY: the truth is from your Lord: let him then who will, believe; and let him who will, be an infidel
 But for the offenders we have got ready the fire whose smoke shall enwrap them: and if they implore help, helped shall they be with water like molten brass which shall scald their Wretched the drink! and an unhappy couch!  But as to those who have believed and done the things that are right,-Verily we will not suffer the reward of him whose works were good, to perish!  For them, the gardens of Eden, under whose shades shall rivers flow: decked shall they be therein with bracelets of gold, and green robes of silk and rich brocade shall they wear, reclining them therein on thrones
 Blissful the reward! and a pleasant couch!11  And set forth to them as a parable two men; on one of whom we bestowed two gardens of grape vines, and surrounded both with palm trees, and placed corn fields between them: Each of the gardens did yield its fruit, and failed not thereof at all:  And we caused a river to flow in their midst: And this man received his fruit, and said, disputing with him, to his companion, "More have I than thou of wealth, and my family is mightier
"  And he went into his garden-to his own soul unjust
 He said, "I do not think that this will ever perish:  And I do not think that 'the Hour' will come: and even if I be taken back to my Lord, I shall surely find a better than it in exchange
"  His fellow said to him, disputing with him, "What ! hast thou no belief in him who created thee of the dust, then of the germs of life,12 then fashioned thee a perfect man?  But God is my Lord; and no other being will I associate with my Lord
  And why didst thou not say when thou enteredst thy garden, 'What God willeth! There is no power but in God
' Though thou seest that I have less than thou of wealth and children,  Yet haply my Lord may bestow on me better than thy garden, and may send his bolts upon it out of Heaven, so that the next dawn shall find it barren dust;  Or its water become deep sunk, so that thou art unable to find it
"  And his fruits were encompassed by destruction
 Then began he to turn down the palms of his hands at what he had spent on it; for its vines were falling down on their trellises, and he said, "Oh that I had not joined any other god to my Lord!"  And he had no host to help him instead of God, neither was he able to help himself
  Protection in such a case is of God-the Truth: He is the best rewarder, and He bringeth to the best issue
  And set before them a similitude of the present life
 It is as water which we send down from Heaven, and the herb of the Earth is mingled with it, and on the morrow it becometh dry stubble which the winds scatter: for God hath power over all things
  Wealth and children are the adornment of this present life: but good works, which are lasting, are better in the sight of thy Lord as to recompense, and better as to hope
  And call to mind the day when we will cause the mountains to pass away,13 and thou shalt see the earth a levelled plain, and we will gather mankind together, and not leave of them any one
  And they shall be set before thy Lord in ranks:-"Now are ye come unto us as we created you at first: but ye thought that we should not make good to you the promise
"  And each shall have his book put into his hand: and thou shalt see the wicked in alarm at that which is therein: and they shall say, "O woe to us! what meaneth this Book? It leaveth neither small nor great unnoted down!" And they shall find all that they have wrought present to them, and thy Lord will not deal unjustly with any one
  When we said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they all prostrated them save Eblis, who was of the Djinn,14 and revolted from his Lord's behest
 behest
-What! will ye then take him and his offspring as patrons rather than Me? and they your enemies? Sad exchange for the ungodly!  I made them not witnesses of the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth, nor of their own creation, neither did I take seducers as my helpers
  On a certain day, God shall say, "Call ye on the companions ye joined with me, deeming them to be gods:" and they shall call on them, but they shall not answer them: then will we place a valley of perdition between them:  And the wicked shall see the fire, and shall have a foreboding that they shall be flung into it, and they shall find no escape from it
  And now in this Koran we have presented to man similitudes of every kind: but, at most things is man a caviller
  And what, now that guidance is come to them, letteth men from believing and from asking forgiveness of their Lord-unless they wait till that the doom of the ancients overtake them, or the chastisement come upon them in the sight of the universe?  We send not our Sent Ones but to announce and to warn: but the infidels cavil with vain words in order to refute the truth; and they treat my signs and their own warnings with scorn
  But who is worse than he who when told of the signs of his Lord turneth him away and forgetteth what in time past his hands have wrought? Truly we have thrown veils over their hearts lest they should understand this Koran, and into their ears a heaviness:  And if thou bid them to "the guidance" yet will they not even then be guided ever
  The gracious one, full of compassion, is thy Lord! if he would have chastised them for their demerits he would have hastened their chastisement
 But they have a time fixed for the accomplishment of our menaces: and beside God they shall find no refuge
  And those cities did we destroy when they became impious; and of their coming destruction we gave them warning
  Remember when Moses said to his servant, "I will not stop till I reach the confluence of the two seas,15 or for years will I journey on
"  But when they reached their confluence, they forgot their fish, and it took its way in the sea at will
  And when they had passed on, said Moses to his servant, "Bring us our morning meal; for now have we incurred weariness from this journey
"  He said, "What thinkest thou? When we repaired to the rock for rest I forgot the fish; and none but Satan made me forget it, so as not to mention it; and it hath taken its way in the sea in a wondrous sort
"  He said, "It is this we were in quest of
"16 And they both went back retracing their footsteps
  Then found they one of our servants to whom we had vouchsafed our mercy, and whom we had instructed with our knowledge
  And Moses said to him, "Shall I follow thee that thou teach me, for guidance, of that which thou too hast been taught?"  He said, "Verily, thou canst not have patience with me;  How canst thou be patient in matters whose meaning thou comprehendest not?"  He said, "Thou shalt find me patient if God please, nor will I disobey thy bidding
"  He said, "Then, if thou follow me, ask me not of aught until I have given thee an account thereof
"  So they both went on, till they embarked in a ship, and he-the unknown-staved it in
 "What!" said Moses, "hast thou staved it in that thou mayest drown its crew? a strange thing now hast thou done!"  He said, "Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not have patience with me?"  He said, "Chide me not that I forgat, nor lay on me a hard command
"  Then went they on till they met a youth, and he slew him
 Said Moses, "Hast thou slain him who is free from guilt of blood? Now hast thou wrought a grievous thing!"  He said, "Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not have patience with me?"  Moses said, "If after this I ask thee aught, then let me be thy comrade no longer; but now hast thou my excuse
"  They went on till they came to the people of a city
 Of this people they asked food, but they refused them for guests
 And they found in it a wall that was about to fall, and he set it upright
 Said Moses, "If thou hadst wished, for this thou mightest have obtained pay
"  He said, "This is the parting point between me and thee
 But I will first tell thee the meaning of that which thou couldst not await with patience
  "As to the vessel, it belonged to poor men who toiled upon the sea, and I was minded to damage it, for in their rear was a king who seized every ship by force
  As to the youth his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should trouble them by error and infidelity
  And we desired that their Lord might give them in his place a child, better than he in virtue, and nearer to filial piety
  And as to the wall, it belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and beneath it was their treasure: and their father was a righteous man: and thy Lord desired that they should reach the age of strength, and take forth their treasure through the mercy of thy Lord
 And not of mine own will have I done this
 This is the interpretation of that which thou couldst not bear with patience
"  They will ask thee of Dhoulkarnain [the two-horned17]
 SAY: I will recite to you an account of him
  We stablished his power upon the earth, and made for him a way to everything
 And a route he followed,  Until when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it to set in a miry fount; and hard by he found a people
  We said, "O Dhoulkarnain! either chastise or treat them generously
"  "The impious," said he, "will we surely chastise;" then shall he be taken back to his Lord, and he will chastise him with a grievous chastisement
  But as to him who believeth and doeth that which is right, he shall have a generous recompense, and we will lay on them our easy behests
  Then followed he a route,  Until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it to rise on a people to whom we had given no shelter from it
  Thus it was
  And we had full knowledge of the forces that were with him
  Then followed he a route  Until he came between the two mountains, beneath which he found a people who scarce understood a language
  They said, "O Dhoulkarnain! verily, Gog and Magog18 waste this land; shall we then pay thee tribute, so thou build a rampart19 between us and them?"  He said, "Better than your tribute is the might wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me; but help me strenuously, and I will set a barrier between you and them
  Bring me blocks of iron,"-until when it filled the space between the mountain sides-"Ply," said he, "your bellows,"-until when he had made it red with heat (fire), he said,-"Bring me molten brass that I may pour upon it
"  And Gog and Magog were not able to scale it, neither were they able to dig through it
  "This," said he, "is a mercy from my Lord:  But when the promise of my Lord shall come to pass, he will turn it to dust; and the promise of my Lord is true
"  On that day we will let them dash like billows one over another; and there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and we will gather them together in a body
  And we will set Hell on that day close before the infidels,  Whose eyes were veiled from my warning, and who had no power to hear
  What! do the infidels think that they can take my servants as their patrons, beside Me? Verily, we have got Hell ready as the abode of the infidels
  SAY: Shall we tell you who they are that have lost their labour most?  Whose aim in the present life hath been mistaken, and who deem that what they do is right?  They are those who believe not in the signs of the Lord, or that they shall ever meet him
 Vain, therefore, are their works; and no weight will we allow them on the day of resurrection
  This shall be their reward-Hell
20 Because they were unbelievers, and treated my signs and my Apostles with scorn
  But as for those who believe and do the things that are right, they shall have the gardens of Paradise21 for their abode:  They shall remain therein for ever: they shall wish for no change from it
  SAY: Should the sea become ink, to write the words of my Lord, the sea would surely fail ere the words of my Lord would fail, though we brought its like in aid
  SAY: In sooth I am only a man like you
 It hath been revealed to me that your God is one only God: let him then who hopeth to meet his Lord work a righteous work: nor let him give any other creature a share in the worship of his Lord

1 This Book is without a doubt a Revelation sent down from the Lord of the Worlds
  Will they say, He hath forged it? Nay, it is the truth from thy Lord that thou mayest warn a people to whom no warner hath come before thee, that haply they may be guided
  God it is who hath created the Heavens and the Earth and all that is between them in six days; then ascended his throne
 Save Him ye have no patron, and none to plead for you
 Will ye not then reflect?  From the Heaven to the Earth He governeth all things: hereafter shall they come up to him on a day whose length shall be a thousand of such years as ye reckon
2  This is He who knoweth the unseen and the seen; the Mighty, the Merciful,  Who hath made everything which he hath created most good; and began the creation of man with clay;  Then ordained his progeny from germs of life,3 from sorry water:  Then shaped him, and breathed of His Spirit into him, and gave you hearing and seeing and hearts: what little thanks do ye return!  And they say, "What! when we shall have lain hidden in the earth, shall we become a new creation?"  Yea, they deny that they shall meet their Lord
  SAY: The angel of death who is charged with you shall cause you to die: then shall ye be returned to your Lord
  Couldst thou but see when the guilty shall droop their heads before their Lord, and cry, "O our Lord! we have seen and we have heard: return us then to life: we will do that which is right
 Verily we believe firmly!"  (Had we pleased we had certainly given to every soul its guidance
 But true shall be the word which hath gone forth from me-I will surely fill hell with Djinn and men together
)  "Taste then the recompense of your having forgotten the meeting with this your day
 We, too, we have forgotten you: taste then an eternal punishment for that which ye have wrought
"  They only believe in our signs, who, when mention is made of them, fall down in ADORATION, and celebrate the praise of their Lord, and are not puffed up with disdain:  Who, as they raise them4 from their couches, call on their Lord with fear and desire, and give alms of that with which we have supplied them
  No soul knoweth what joy of the eyes is reserved for the good in recompense of their works
  Shall he then who is a believer be as he who sinneth grossly? they shall not be held alike
  As to those who believe and do that which is right, they shall have gardens of eternal abode as the meed of their works:  But as for those who grossly sin, their abode shall be the fire: so oft as they shall desire to escape out of it, back shall they be turned into it
 And it shall be said to them, Taste ye the torment of the fire, which ye treated as a lie
  And we will surely cause them to taste a punishment yet nearer at hand, besides the greater punishment, that haply they may turn to us in penitence
  Who acteth worse than he who is warned by the signs of his Lord, then turneth away from them? We will surely take vengeance on the guilty ones
  We heretofore gave the Book of the law to Moses: have thou no doubt as to our meeting with him:5 and we appointed it for the guidance of the children of Israel
  And we appointed Imâms from among them who should guide after our command when they had themselves endured with constancy, and had firmly believed in our signs
  Now thy Lord! He will decide between them on the day of resurrection as to the subject of their disputes
  Is it not notorious to them how many generations, through whose abodes they walk, we have destroyed before them? Truly herein are sings: will they not then hear?  See they not how we drive the rain to some parched land and thereby bring forth corn of which their cattle and themselves do eat? Will they not then behold?  They say, "When will this decision take place? Tell us, if ye are men of truth?"  SAY: On the day of that decision, the faith of infidels shall not avail them, and they shall have no further respite
  Stand aloof from them then, and wait thou, for they too wait

2 A Revelation from the Compassionate, the Merciful!  A Book whose verses (signs) are MADE PLAIN-an Arabic Koran, for men of knowledge;  Announcer of glad tidings and charged with warnings! But most of them withdraw and hearken not:  And they say, "Our hearts are under shelter from thy teachings, and in our ears is a deafness, and between us and thee there is a veil
 Act as thou thinkest right: we verily shall act as we think right
"  SAY: I am only a man like you
3 It is revealed to me that your God is one God: go straight then to Him, and implore his pardon
 And woe to those who join gods with God;  Who pay not the alms of obligation, and in the life to come believe not!  But they who believe and do the things that are right shall receive a perfect4 recompense
  SAY: Do ye indeed disbelieve in Him who in two days created the earth? and do ye assign Him peers? The Lord of the worlds is He!  And he hath placed on the earth the firm mountains which tower above it; and He hath blessed it, and distributed food throughout it, for the cravings of all alike, in four days:  Then He applied himself to the Heaven, which then was but smoke: and to it and to the Earth He said, "Come ye, whether in obedience or against your will?" and they both said, "We come obedient
"  And He made them seven heavens in two days, and in each heaven made known its office: And we furnished the lower heaven with lights and guardian angels
 This, the disposition of the Almighty, the All-knowing
  If they turn away, then SAY: I warn you of a tempest, like the tempest of Ad and Themoud!  When the apostles came to them on every side,5 saying, "Worship none but God," they said, "Had our Lord been pleased to send down, He had surely sent down angels; and in sooth, your message we do not believe
"  As to Ad, they bore them proudly and unjustly in the land, and said, "Who more mighty than we in prowess?" Saw they not that God their creator was mightier than they in prowess? And they rejected our signs
  Therefore on ill-omened days did we send against them an impetuous blast that we might make them taste the chastisement of shame in this world:-but more shameful shall be the chastisement of the life to come; and they shall not be protected
  And as to Themoud, we had vouchsafed them guidance; but to guidance did they prefer blindness; wherefore the tempest of a shameful punishment overtook them for their doings:  But we rescued the believing and the God-fearing:  And warn of the day when the enemies of God shall be gathered6 unto the fire urged on in bands:  Until when they reach it, their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them of their deeds:  And they shall say to their skins, "Why witness ye against us?" They shall say, "God, who giveth a voice to all things, hath given us a voice: He created you at first, and to Him are ye brought back
  And ye did not hide yourselves so that neither your ears nor your eyes nor your skins should witness against you: but ye thought that God knew not many a thing that ye did!  And this your thought which ye did think of your Lord hath ruined you, so that ye are become of those who perish
"  And be they patient, still the fire shall be their abode: or if they beg for favour, yet shall they not be of favoured
  And we will appoint Satans as their fast companions; for it was they who made their present and future state seem fair and right to them; and the sentence passed on the peoples of Djinn and men who flourished before them hath become their due, and they shall perish
  Yet the unbelievers say, "Hearken not to this Koran, but keep up a talking, that ye may overpower the voice of the reader
"  Surely therefore will we cause the unbelievers to taste a terrible punishment;  And recompense them according to the worst of their actions
  This the reward of the enemies of God,-the Fire! it shall be their eternal abode, in requital for their gainsaying our signs
  And they who believed not shall say, "O our Lord! shew us those of the Djinn and men who led us astray: both of them will we put under out feet, that they may be of the humbled
"  But as for those who say, "Our Lord is God;" and who go straight to Him,7 angels shall descend to them and say, "Fear ye not, neither be ye grieved, but rejoice ye in the paradise which ye have been promised
  We are your guardians in this life and in the next: your's therein shall be your soul's desire, and your's therein whatever ye shall ask for,  The hospitality of a Gracious, a Merciful One
"  And who speaketh fairer than he who biddeth to God and doth the thing that is right, and saith, "I for my part am of the Muslims"?  Moreover, good and evil are not to be treated as the same thing
 Turn away evil by what is better, and lo! he between whom and thyself was enmity, shall be as though he were a warm friend
  But none attain to this save men steadfast in patience, and none attain to it except the most highly favoured
8  And if an enticement from Satan entice thee, then take refuge in God, for He is the Hearing, the Knowing
  And among his signs are the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon
 Bend not in adoration to the sun or the moon, but bend in adoration before God who created them both, if ye would serve Him
  But if they are too proud for this, yet they who are with thy Lord do celebrate His praises night and day,9 and cease not
  And among His signs is this, that thou seest the earth drooping: but, when we send down the rain upon it, it is stirred and swelleth; verily He who giveth it life, will surely give life to the dead; for His might extendeth over all things
10  They truly who with obloquy disown our signs are not hidden from us
 Is he then who shall be cast into the fire, or he who shall come forth secure on the day of resurrection, in the better position? Do what ye will: but His eye is on all your doings
  Verily, they who believe not in "the warning," after it hath come to them 
 
 
 and yet the Koran is a glorious book!  Falsehood, from whatever side it cometh, shall not come night it;11 it is a missive down from the Wise, the Praiseworthy
  Nothing hath been said to thee which hath not been said of old to apostles before thee
 Verily with thy Lord is forgiveness, and with Him is terrible retribution
  Had we made it a Koran in a foreign tongue, they had surely said, "Unless its signs be made clear 
 
 
 !12 What! in a foreign tongue? and the people Arabian?" SAY: It is to those who believe a guide and a medicine;13 but as to those who believe not, there is a thickness in their ears, and to them it is a blindness: they are like those who are called to from afar
  Of old we gave the Book to Moses, and disputes arose about it: and if a decree of respite from thy Lord had gone before, there would surely have been a decision between them: for great were their doubts and questionings about it
14  He who doth right-it is for himself:15 and he who doth evil-it is for himself: and thy Lord will not deal unfairly with his servants
  With Him alone16 is the knowledge of "the Hour
" No fruit cometh forth from its coverings, neither doth any female conceive, nor is she delivered, but with His knowledge
 And on that day He shall call men to Him, saying, "Where are the companions ye gave me?" They shall say, "We own to thee, there is no one of us can witness for them
"  And what they erst called on shall pass away from them, and they shall perceive that there will be no escape for them
  Man ceaseth not to pray for good: but if evil betide him he despondeth, despairing
  And if we cause him to taste our mercy after affliction hath touched him, he is sure to say, "This is my due: and I take no thought of the Hour of Resurrection: and if I be brought back to my Lord, I shall indeed attain with Him my highest good
" But we will then certainly declare their doings to the Infidels, and cause them to taste a stern punishment
  When we are gracious to man, he withdraweth and turneth him aside: but when evil toucheth him, he is a man of long prayers
  SAY: What think ye? If this Book be from God and ye believe it not, who will have gone further astray than he who is at a distance from it?  We will shew them our signs in different countries and among themselves, until it become plain to them that it is the truth
 Is it not enough for thee that thy Lord is witness of all things?  Are they not in doubt as to the meeting with their Lord? But doth he not encompass all things?   _______________________  1 In some MSS

-36 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  HA
 MIM
1 This Book is sent down2 from God, the Mighty, the Wise!  Assuredly in the Heavens and the Earth are signs for those who believe:  And in your own creation, and in the beasts which are scattered abroad are signs to the firm in faith:  And in the succession of night and day, and in the supply which God sendeth down from the Heaven whereby He giveth life to the earth when dead, and in the change of the winds, are signs for a people of discernment
  Such are the signs of God: with truth do we recite them to thee
 But in what teaching will they believe, if they reject3 God and his signs?  Woe to every lying sinner,  Who heareth the signs of God recited to him, and then, as though he heard them not, persisteth in proud disdain! Apprise him of an afflictive punishment
  And when he becometh acquainted with any of our signs he turneth them into ridicule
 These! a shameful punishment for them!  Hell is behind them! and neither their gains nor the lords whom they have adopted beside God shall avail them in the least: and theirs, a great punishment!  This is "Guidance:" and for those who disbelieve the signs of their Lord is the punishment of an afflictive torment
  It is God who hath subjected the sea to you that the ships may traverse it at his bidding, and that ye may go in quest of the gifts of his bounty, and that ye may be thankful
  And he hath subjected to you all that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth: all is from him
 Verily, herein are signs for those who reflect
  Tell the believers to pardon those who hope not for the days of God4 in which He purposeth to reward men according to their deeds
  He who doth that which is right, doth it to his own behoof, and whoso doth evil, doth it to his own hurt
 Hereafter, to your Lord shall ye be brought back
  To the children of Israel gave we of old the Book and the Wisdom, and the gift of Prophecy, and we supplied them with good things, and privileged them above all peoples:  And we gave them clear sanctions for our behests: neither did they differ, through mutual envy, till after they had become possessed of knowledge; but thy Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection, as to the subject of their disputes
  Afterwards we set thee over our divine law:5 follow it then: and follow not the wishes of those who have no knowledge,  For against God shall they avail thee nothing
 And in sooth, the doers of evil are one another's patrons; but the patron of them that fear Him is God himself
  This Book hath insight for mankind, and a Guidance and Mercy to a people who are firm in faith
  Deem they whose gettings are only evil, that we will deal with them as with those who believe and work righteousness, so that their lives and deaths shall be alike? Ill do they judge
  In all truth hath God created the Heavens and the Earth, that he may reward every one as he shall have wrought; and they shall not be wronged
  What thinkest thou? He who hath made a God of his passions, and whom God causeth wilfully to err, and whose ears and whose heart he hath sealed up, and over whose sight he hath placed a veil-who, after his rejection by God, shall guide such a one? Will ye not then be warned?  And they say, "There is only this our present life: we die and we live, and nought but time destroyeth us
" But in this they have no knowledge: it is merely their own conceit
  And when our clear signs are recited to them, their only argument is to say, "Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth
"  Say: God giveth you life, then causeth you to die: then will He assemble you on the day of resurrection: there is no doubt of it: but most men have not this knowledge
  And God's is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth; and on the day when the Hour shall arrive, on that day shall the despisers6 perish
  And thou shalt see every nation KNEELING: to its own book shall every nation be summoned:-”This day shall ye be repaid as ye have wrought
  This our Book will speak of you with truth: therein have we written down whatever ye have done
"  As to those who have believed and wrought righteously, into his mercy shall their Lord cause them to enter
 This shall be undoubted bliss!  But as to the Infidels-"Were not my signs recited to you? but ye proudly scorned them, and became a sinful people
"  And when it was said, "Verily the Promise of God is truth; and as to the Hour, there is no doubt of it;" ye said, "We know not what the hour is-we conceive it a mere conceit,-we have no assurance of it
"  And the evils they have wrought shall rise up into their view, and that at which they mocked shall hem them in on every side
  And it shall be said to them, "This day will we forget you as ye forgat your meeting with us this day, and your abode shall be the fire, and none shall there be to succour you:-  This, because ye received the signs of God with mockery, and this present life deceived you
" On that day therefore they shall not come out from it; and they shall not be asked to win the favour of God
  Praise then be to God, Lord of the Heavens and Lord of the Earth; the Lord of the worlds!  And His be the greatness in the Heavens and on the Earth; for He is the Mighty, the Wise!   _______________________  1 See Sura lxviii

-THE BEE [LXXIII
]  MECCA
-128 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  THE doom of God cometh to pass
 Then hasten it not
 Glory be to Him! High let Him be exalted above the gods whom they join with Him!  By his own behest will He cause the angels to descend with the Spirit on whom he pleaseth among his servants, bidding them, "Warn that there is no God but me; therefore fear me
"  He hath created the Heavens and the Earth to set forth his truth;1 high let Him be exalted above the gods they join with Him!  Man hath He created from a moist germ;2 yet lo! man is an open caviller
  And the cattle! for you hath He created them: in them ye have warm garments and gainful uses; and of them ye eat:  And they beseem you well3 when ye fetch them home and when ye drive them forth to pasture:  And they carry your burdens to lands which ye could not else reach but with travail of soul: truly your Lord is full of goodness, and merciful:  And He hath given you horses, mules, and asses, that ye may ride them, and for your ornament: and things of which ye have no knowledge hath he created
  Of God it is to point out "the Way
" Some turn aside from it: but had He pleased, He had guided you all aright
  It is He who sendeth down rain out of Heaven: from it is your drink; and from it are the plants by which ye pasture
  By it He causeth the corn, and the olives, and the palm-trees, and the grapes to spring forth for you, and all kinds of fruits: verily, in this are signs for those who ponder
  And He hath subjected to you the night and the day; the sun and the moon and the stars too are subjected to you by his behest; verily, in this are signs for those who understand:  And all of varied hues that He hath created for you over the earth: verily, in this are signs for those who remember
  And He it is who hath subjected the sea to you, that ye may eat of its fresh fish, and take forth from it ornaments to wear-thou seest the ships ploughing its billows-and that ye may go in quest of his bounties, and that ye might give thanks
  And He hath thrown firm mountains on the earth, least it move with you; and rivers and paths for your guidance,  And way marks
 By the stars too are men guided
  Shall He then who hath created be as he who hath not created? Will ye not consider?  And if ye would reckon up the favours of God, ye could not count them
 Aye! God is right Gracious, Merciful!  And God knoweth what ye conceal, and what ye bring to light,  While the gods whom they call on beside God, create nothing, but are themselves created:  Dead are they, lifeless! and they know not  When they shall be raised!  Your God is the one God: and they who believe not in a future life, have hearts given to denial, and are men of pride:-  Beyond a doubt God knoweth what they conceal and what they manifest:-  He truly loveth not the men of pride
  For when it is said to them, "What is this your Lord hath sent down?" they say, "Fables of the ancients,"-  That on the day of resurrection they may bear their own entire burden, and the burden of those whom they, in their ignorance, misled
 Shall it not be a grievous burden for them?  They who were before them did plot of old
 But God attacked their building at its foundation the roof fell on them from above; and, whence they looked not for it, punishment overtook them:4  On the day of resurrection, too, will He shame them
 He will say, "Where are the gods ye associated with me, the subjects of your disputes?" They to whom "the knowledge" hath been given will say, Verily, this day shall shame and evil fall upon the infidels
  The sinners against their own souls whom the angels shall cause to die will proffer the submission, "No evil have we done
" Nay! God knoweth what ye have wrought:  Enter ye therefore the gates of Hell to remain therein for ever: and horrid the abiding place of the haughty ones!  But to those who have feared God it shall be said, "What is this that your Lord hath awarded?" They shall say, "That which is best
 To those who do good, a good reward in this present world; but better the mansion of the next, and right pleasant the abode of the God-fearing!"  Gardens of Eden into which they shall enter; rivers shall flow beneath their shades; all they wish for shall they find therein! Thus God rewardeth those who fear Him;  To whom, as righteous persons, the angels shall say, when they receive their souls, "Peace be on you! Enter Paradise as the meed of your labours
"  What can the infidels expect but that the angels of death come upon them, or that a sentence of thy Lord take effect? Thus did they who flourished before them
 God was not unjust to them, but to their ownselves were they unjust;  And the ill which they had done recoiled upon them, and that which they had scoffed at encompassed them round about
  They who have joined other gods with God say, "Had He pleased, neither we nor our fathers had worshipped aught but him; nor should we, apart from him, have forbidden aught
" Thus acted they who were before them
 Yet is the duty of the apostles other than public preaching?  And to every people have we sent an apostle saying:-Worship God and turn away from Taghout
5 Some of them there were whom God guided, and there were others decreed to err
 But go through the land and see what hath been the end of those who treated my apostles as liars!  If thou art anxious for their guidance, know that God will not guide him whom He would lead astray, neither shall they have any helpers
  And they swear by God with their most sacred oath that "God will never raise him who once is dead
" Nay, but on Him is a promise binding, though most men know it not,-  That He may clear up to them the subject of their disputes, and that the infidels may know that they are liars
  Our word to a thing when we will it, is but to say, "Be," and it is
6  And as to those who when oppressed have fled their country for the sake of God, we will surely provide them a goodly abode in this world, but greater the reward of the next life, did they but know it  They who bear ills with patience and put their trust in the Lord!  None have we sent before thee but men inspired ask of those who have Books of Monition,7 if ye know it not-  With proofs of their mission and Scriptures: and to thee have we sent down this Book of Monition that thou mayest make clear to men what hath been sent down to them, and that they may ponder it
  What! Are they then who have plotted mischiefs, sure that God will not cause the earth to cleave under them? or that a chastisement will not come upon them whence they looked not for it?  Or that He will not seize upon them in their comings and goings, while they shall not be able to resist him?  Or that he will not seize them with some slowly wasting scourge? But verily your Lord is Good, Gracious
  Have they not seen how everything which God hath created turneth its shadow right and left, prostrating itself before God in all abasement?  And all in the Heavens and all on the Earth, each thing that moveth, and the very angels, prostrate them in adoration before God, and are free from pride;  They fear their Lord who is above them, and do what they are bidden:  For God hath said, "Take not to yourselves two gods, for He is one God: me, therefore! yea, me revere!  All in the Heavens and in the Earth is His! His due unceasing service! Will ye then fear any other than God?  And all your blessings are assuredly from God: then, when trouble befalleth you, to Him ye turn for help:  Then when He relieveth you of the trouble, lo! some of you join associates with your Lord:-  To prove how thankless are they for our gifts! Enjoy yourselves then: but in the end ye shall know the truth
  And for idols, of which they know nothing, they set apart a share of our bounties! By God ye shall be called to account for your devices!  And they ascribe daughters unto God! Glory be to Him! But they desire them not for themselves:8  For when the birth of a daughter is announced to any one of them, dark shadows settle on his face, and he is sad:  He hideth him from the people because of the ill tidings: shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it in the dust?9 Are not their judgments wrong?  To whatever is evil may they be likened who believe not in a future life;10 but God is to be likened to whatever is loftiest: for He is the Mighty, the Wise
  Should God punish men for their perverse doings, he would not leave on earth a moving thing! but to an appointed term doth He respite them; and when their term is come, they shall not delay or advance it an hour
  Yet what they loathe themselves do they assign to God; and their tongues utter the lie, that theirs shall be a goodly lot
 But beyond a doubt is it that the fire awaiteth them, and that they shall be the first sent into it
  By God we have sent Apostles to nations before thee, but Satan prepared their work for them, and this day is he their liege; and a woeful punishment doth await them
  And we have sent down the Book to thee only, that thou mightest clear up to them the subject of their wranglings, and as a guidance and a mercy to those who believe
  And God sendeth down water from Heaven, and by it giveth life to the Earth after it hath been dead: verily, in this is a sign to those who hearken
  Ye have also teaching from the cattle
 We give you drink of the pure milk, between dregs and blood, which is in their bellies; the pleasant beverage of them that quaff it
  And among fruits ye have the palm and the vine, from which ye get wine and healthful nutriment: in this, verily, are signs for those who reflect
  And thy Lord hath taught the BEE, saying: "Provide thee houses in the mountains, and in the trees, and in the hives which men do build thee:  Feed, moreover, on every kind of fruit, and walk the beaten paths of thy Lord
" From its belly cometh forth a fluid of varying hues,11 which yieldeth medicine to man
 Verily in this is a sign for those who consider
  And God hath created you; by and bye will he take you to himself; and some among you will he carry on to abject old age, when all that once was known is known no longer
 Aye, God is Knowing, Powerful
  And God hath abounded to some of you more than to others in the supplies of life; yet they to whom He hath abounded, impart not thereof to the slaves whom their right hands possess, so that they may share alike
 What! will they deny, then, that these boons are from God?  God, too, hath given you wives of your own race, and from your wives hath He given you sons and grandsons, and with good things hath he supplied you
 What, will they then believe in vain idols? For God's boons they are ungrateful!  And they worship beside God those who neither out of the Heavens or Earth can provide them a particle of food, and have no power in themselves!  Make no comparisons, therefore, with God
12 Verily, God hath knowledge, but ye have not
  God maketh comparison between a slave13 the property of his lord, who hath no power over anything, and a free man whom we have ourselves supplies, and who giveth alms therefrom both in secret and openly
 Shall they be held equal? No: praise be to God! But most men know it not
  God setteth forth also a comparison between two men, one of whom is dumb from his birth, and hath no power over anything, and is a burden to his lord: send him where he will, he cometh not back with success
 Shall he and the man who enjoineth what is just, and keepeth in the straight path, be held equal?  God's are the secrets of the Heavens and of the Earth! and the business of the last hour will be but as the twinkling of an eye, or even less
 Yes! for all things is God Potent
  God hath brought you out of your mothers' wombs devoid of all knowledge; but hath given you hearing, and sight, and heart, that haply ye might render thanks
  Have they never looked up at the birds subjected to Him in Heaven's vault? None holdeth them in hand but God! In this are signs for those who believe
  And God hath given you tents to dwell in: and He hath given you the skins of beasts for tents, that ye may find them light when ye shift your quarters, or when ye halt; and from their wool and soft fur and hair, hath He supplied you with furniture and goods for temporary use
  And from the things which He hath created, hath God provided shade for you, and hath given you the mountains for places of shelter, and hath given you garments to defend you from the heat, and garments to defend you in your wars
 Thus doth He fill up the measure of His goodness towards you, that you may resign yourselves to Him
  But if they turn their backs, still thy office is only plain spoken preaching
  They own the goodness of God-then they disown it-and most of them are infidels
  But one day, we will raise up a witness out of every nation: them shall the infidels have no permission to make excuses, and they shall find no favour
  And when they who have acted thus wrongly shall behold their torment, it shall not be made light to them, nor will God deign to look upon them
  And when they who had joined associates with God shall see those their associate-gods, they shall say, "O our Lord! these are our associate-gods whom we called upon beside Thee
" But they shall retort on them, "Verily, ye are liars
"  And on that day shall they proffer submission to God; and the deities of their own invention shall vanish from them
  As for those who were infidels and turned others aside from the way of God, to them we will add punishment on punishment for their corrupt doings
  And one day we will summon up in every people a witness against them from among themselves; and we will bring thee up as a witness against these Meccans: for to thee have we sent down the Book which cleareth up everything, a guidance, and mercy, and glad tidings to those who resign themselves to God (to Muslims)
  Verily, God enjoineth justice and the doing of good and gifts to kindred, and he forbiddeth wickedness and wrong and oppression
 He warneth you that haply ye may be mindful
  Be faithful in the covenant of God when ye have covenanted, and break not your oaths after ye have pledged them: for now have ye made God to stand surety for you
 Verily, God hath knowledge of what ye do
  And, because you are a more numerous people than some other people, be not like her who unravelleth the thread which she had strongly spun, by taking your oaths with mutual perfidy
 God is making trial of you in this: and in the day of resurrection he will assuredly clear up to you that concerning which ye are now at variance
  Had God pleased, He could have made you one people: but He causeth whom He will to err, and whom He will He guideth: and ye shall assuredly be called to account for your doings
  Therefore take not your oaths with mutual fraud, lest your foot slip after it hath been firmly fixed, and ye taste of evil because ye have turned others aside from the way of God, and great be your punishment
  And barter not the covenant of God for a mean price; for with God is that which is better for you, if ye do but understand
  All that is with you passeth away, but that which is with God abideth
 With a reward meet for their best deeds will we surely recompense those who have patiently endured
  Whoso doeth that which is right, whether male or female, if a believer, him will we surely quicken to a happy life, and recompense them with a reward meet for their best deeds
  When thou readest the Koran, have recourse to God for help against Satan the stoned,14  For no power hath he over those who believe, and put their trust in their Lord,  But only hath he power over those who turn away from God, and join other deities with Him
  And when we change one (sign) verse for another, and God knoweth best what He revealeth, they say, "Thou art only a fabricator
" Nay! but most of them have no knowledge
  SAY: The Holy Spirit15 hath brought it down with truth from thy Lord, that He may stablish those who have believed, and as guidance and glad tidings to the Muslims
  We also know that they say, "Surely a certain person teacheth him
" But the tongue of him at whom they hint is foreign,16 while this Koran is in the plain Arabic
  As for those who believe not in the signs of God, God will not guide them, and a sore torment doth await them
  Surely they invent a lie who believe not in the signs of God-and they are the liars
  Whoso, after he hath believed in God denieth him, if he were forced to it and if his heart remain steadfast in the faith, shall be guiltless:17 but whoso openeth his breast to infidelity-on such shall be wrath from God, and a severe punishment awaiteth them
  This, because they have loved this present life beyond the next, and because God guideth not the unbelievers!  These are they whose hearts and ears and eyes God hath sealed up: these are the careless ones: in the next world shall they perish beyond a doubt
  To those also who after their trials fled their country,18 then fought and endured with patience, verily, thy Lord will in the end be forgiving, gracious
  On a certain day shall every soul come to plead for itself, and every soul shall be repaid according to its deeds; and they shall not be wronged
  God proposeth the instance of a city,19 secure and at ease, to which its supplies come in plenty from every side
 But she was thankless for the boons of God; God therefore made her taste the woe20 of famine and of fear, for what they had done
  Moreover, an apostle of their own people came to them, and they treated him as an impostor
 So chastisement overtook them because they were evil doers
  Of what God hath supplied you eat the lawful and good, and be grateful for the favours of God, if ye are his worshippers
  Forbidden to you is that only which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that which hath been slain in the name of any other than God: but if any be forced, and neither lust for it nor wilfully transgress, then verily God is forgiving, gracious
21  And say not with a lie upon your tongue, "This is lawful and this is forbidden:" for so will ye invent a lie concerning God: but they who invent a lie of God shall not prosper:  Brief their enjoyment, but sore their punishment!  To the Jews22 we have forbidden that of which we before told thee; we injured them not, but they injured themselves
  To those who have done evil in ignorance, then afterwards have repented and amended, verily thy Lord is in the end right gracious, merciful
  Verily, Abraham was a leader in religion:23 obedient to God, sound in faith:24 he was not of those who join gods with God
  Grateful was he for His favours: God chose him and guided him into the straight way;  And we bestowed on him good things in this world: and in the world to come he shall be among the just
  We have moreover revealed to thee that thou follow the religion of Abraham, the sound in faith
 He was not of those who join gods with God
  The Sabbath was only ordained for those who differed about it: and of a truth thy Lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection as to the subject of their disputes
  Summon thou to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and with kindly warning: dispute with them in the kindest manner: thy Lord best knoweth those who stray from his way, and He best knoweth those who have yielded to his guidance
  If ye make reprisals,25 then make them to the same extent that ye were injured: but if ye can endure patiently, best will it be for the patiently enduring
  Endure then with patience
 But thy patient endurance must be sought in none but God
 And be not grieved about the infidels, and be not troubled at their devices; for God is with those who fear him and do good deeds

 a Hanyf
 According to a tradition in Waquidi, fol
 255, Zaid (who died only five years before Muhammad received his first inspiration, and undoubtedly prepared the way for many of his subsequent announcements) adopted this term at the instance of a Christian and a Jew, who exhorted him to become a Hanyf
 Zaid having at this time renounced idolatry, and being unable to receive either Judaism or Christianity, "What," said he, "is a Hanyf?" They both told him, it was the religion of Abraham, who worshipped nothing but God
 On this Zaid exclaimed, "O God, I bear witness that I follow the religion of Abraham
" The root, whence Hanyf is derived, means generally to turn from good to bad, or vice versâ, and is equivalent to the verbs convert and pervert
  25 All Muhammadan commentators explain this verse as a prohibition to avenge the death of Hamza on the Meccans with too great severity

-THE GREEKS [LXXIV
]  MECCA
-60 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ELIF
 LAM
 MIM
1  THE GREEKS have been defeated2  In a land hard by: But after their defeat they shall defeat their foes,  In a few years
3  First and last is the affair with God
 And on that day shall the faithful rejoice  In the aid of their God: He aideth whom He will; and He is the Mighty, the Merciful
  It is the promise of God: To his promise God will not be untrue: but most men know it not
  They know the outward shews of this life present, but of the next life are they careless
  Have they not considered within themselves that God hath not created the Heavens and the Earth and all that is between them but for a serious end, and for a fixed term? But truly most men believe not that they shall meet their Lord
  Have they never journeyed through the land, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them? Mightier were they than these in strength; and they broke up the land, and dwelt in it in greater numbers than they who dwell there now; and their apostles came to them with proofs of their mission: and it was not God who would wrong them, but they wronged themselves
  Then evil was the end of the evil doers; because they had treated our signs as lies, and laughed them to scorn
  God bringth forth the creation-then causeth it to return again-then to Him shall ye come back
4  And on the day when the hour shall arrive, the guilty shall be struck dumb for despair,  And they shall have no intercessors from among the gods whom they have joined with God, and they shall deny the gods they joined with Him
  And on that day when the Hour shall arrive, shall men be separated one from another;  And as for those who shall have believed and done the things that are right, they shall enjoy themselves in a flowery mead;  But as for those who shall not have believed, but treated our signs and the meeting of the next life as lies, they shall be given over to the torment
  Glorify God therefore when ye reach the evening, and when ye rise at morn:  And to Him be praise in the Heavens and on the Earth; and at twilight, and when ye rest at noon
  He bringeth forth the living out of the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead out of the living: and He quickeneth the earth when dead
 Thus is it that ye too shall be brought forth
5  And one of his signs it is that He hath created you out of dust; then lo! ye become men who spread themselves far and wide:  And one of his signs it is, that He hath created wives for you of your own species,6 that ye may dwell with them, and hath put love and tenderness between you
 Herein truly are signs for those who reflect
  And among his signs are the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth, and your variety of tongues and colour
 Herein truly are signs for all men
  And of his signs are your sleep by night and by day, and your goings in quest of his bounties
 Herein truly are signs to those who hearken
  And of his signs are, that He sheweth you the lightning, a source of awe and hope; and that He sendeth down rain from the heaven and giveth life by it to the earth when dead
 Herein truly are signs to those who understand
  And of his signs also one is that the Heaven and the Earth stand firm at his bidding: hereafter, when with one summons He shall summon you out of the earth,-lo! forth shall ye come
  His, whatsoever is in the Heavens and on the Earth: all are obedient to him
  And He it is who bringeth a creature forth, then causeth it to return again; and to him is this most easy
 To whatever is loftiest in heaven and earth is He to be likened; and He is the Mighty, the Wise
  He setteth forth to you an instance drawn from yourselves
 Have ye among the slaves whom your right hands have won, any partner in what we have bestowed on you, so that ye share alike? Fear ye them as ye fear each other? (Thus make we our signs clear to men of understanding
)  No, ye do not
 But the wicked, devoid of knowledge, follow their own desires:7 and those whom God shall mislead, who shall guide, and who shall be their protector?  Set thou thy face then, as a true convert,8 towards the Faith which God hath made, and for which He hath made man
 No change is there in the creation of God
 This is the right Faith, but the greater part of men know it not
  And be ye turned to Him, and fear Him, and observe prayer, and be not of those who unite gods with God:  Of those who have split up their religion, and have become sects, where every party rejoices in what is their own
9  When some evil toucheth men, they turn to their Lord and call upon him: then when he hath made them taste his mercy, lo, a part of them join other gods with their Lord,  Ungrateful for our favours! Enjoy yourselves then
 But in the end ye shall know your folly
  Have we sent down to them any mandate which speaketh in favour of what they join with God?  When we cause men to taste mercy they rejoice in it; but if, for that which their hands have aforetime wrought, evil befall them, they despair
  See they not that God bestoweth full supplies on whom He pleaseth and giveth sparingly to whom He pleaseth? Signs truly are there herein to those who believe
  To him who is of kin to thee give his due, and to the poor and to the wayfarer: this will be best for those who seek the face of God; and with them it shall be well
  Whatever ye put out at usury to increase it with the substance of others shall have no increase from God:10 but whatever ye shall give in alms, as seeking the face of God, shall be doubled to you
  It is God who created you-then fed you-then will cause you to die-then will make you alive
 Is there any of your companion-gods who can do aught of these things? Praise be to Him! and far be He exalted above the gods they join with Him
  Destruction hath appeared by land and by sea on account of what men's hands have wrought, that it might make them taste somewhat of the fruit of their doings, that haply they might turn to God
  SAY: Journey through the land, and see what hath been the end of those who were before you! The greater part of them joined other gods with God
  Set thy face then towards the right faith, ere the day come which none can hinder God from bringing on
11 On that day shall they be parted in twain:  Unbelievers on whom shall be their unbelief; and they who have wrought righteousness, and prepared for themselves couches of repose:  That of his bounty He may reward those who have believed and wrought righteousness; for the unbelievers He loveth not
  And one of his signs is that He sendeth the winds with glad tidings of rain, both that He may cause you to taste his mercy, and that ships may sail at his command, that out of his bounties ye may seek wealth, and that haply ye may render thanks
  We have sent apostles before thee to their peoples, and they presented themselves to them with clear proofs of their mission; and while it behoved us to succour the faithful, we took vengeance on the guilty
  It is God who sendeth the winds and uplifteth the clouds, and, as He pleaseth, spreadeth them on high, and breaketh them up; and thou mayest see the rain issuing from their midst; and when He poureth it down on such of his servants as He pleaseth, lo! they are filled with joy,  Even they who before it was sent down to them, were in mute despair
  Look then at the traces of God's mercy-how after its death he quickeneth the earth! This same God will surely quicken the dead, for to all things His might is equal
  Yet should we send a blast, and should they see their harvest turn yellow, they would afterwards shew themselves ungrateful
  Thou canst not make the dead to hear, neither canst thou make the deaf to hear the call, when they withdraw and turn their backs:  Neither canst thou guide the blind out of their error: in sooth, none shalt thou make to hear, save him who shall believe in our signs: for they are resigned to our will (Muslims)
  It is God who hath created you in weakness, then after weakness hath given you strength: then after strength, weakness and grey hairs: He createth what He will; and He is the Wise, the Powerful
  And on the day whereon the Hour shall arrive, the wicked will swear  That not above an hour have they waited: Even so did they utter lies on earth:  But they to whom knowledge and faith have been given will say, "Ye have waited, in accordance with the book of God, till the day of Resurrection: for this is the day of the Resurrection-but ye knew it not
"  On that day their plea shall not avail the wicked, neither shall they again be bidden to seek acceptance with God
  And now have we set before men, in this Koran, every kind of parable: yet if thou bring them a single verse of it, the infidels will surely say, "Ye are only utterers of vain things
"  It is thus that God hath sealed up the hearts of those who are devoid of knowledge
  But do thou, Muhammad, bear with patience, for true is the promise of God; and let not those who have no firm belief, unsettle thee

 The Muhammadans appeal to this passage as a clear proof of the inspiration of their prophet

-123 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ELIF
 LAM
 RA
1 A book whose verses are stablished in wisdom and then set forth with clearness from the Wise, the All-informed-  That ye worship none other than God-Verily I come to you from Him charged with warnings, announcements;  And that ye seek pardon of your Lord, and then be turned unto Him! Goodly enjoyments will He give you to enjoy until a destined time, and His favours will He bestow on every one who deserves his favours
2 But if ye turn away, then verily I fear for you the chastisement of the great day
  Unto God shall ye return, and over all things is he Potent
  Do they not doubly fold up their breasts, that they may hide themselves from Him?  But when they enshroud themselves in their garments, doth He not know alike what they conceal and what they shew?  For He knoweth the very inmost of their breast
  There is no moving thing on earth whose nourishment dependeth not on God; he knoweth its haunts and final resting place: all is in the clear Book
  And He it is who hath made the Heavens and the Earth in six days: His throne had stood ere this upon the waters,3 that He might make proof which of you4 would excel in works
  And if thou say, "After death ye shall surely be raised again," the infidels will certainly exclaim, "This is nothing but pure sorcery
"  And if we defer their chastisement to some definite time, they will exclaim, "What keepeth it back?" What! will it not come upon them on a day when there shall be none to avert it from them? And that at which they scoffed shall enclose them in on every side
  And if we cause man to taste our mercy, and then deprive him of it, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful
  And if after trouble hath befallen him we cause him to taste our favour, he will surely exclaim, "The evils are passed away from me
" Verily, he is joyous, boastful
  Except those who endure with patience and do the things that are right: these doth pardon await and a great reward
  Perhaps thou wilt suppress a part of what hath been revealed to thee, and wilt be distress at heart lest they say, "If a treasure be not sent down to him, or an angel come with him
 
 
 
" But thou art only a warner, and God hath all things in his charge
  If they shall say, "The Koran is his own device," SAY: Then bring ten Suras like it5 of your devising, and call whom ye can to your aid beside God, if ye are men of truth
  But if they answer you not, then know that it hath been sent down to you in the wisdom of God only, and that there is no God but He
 Are ye then Muslims?  Those who choose this present life and its braveries, we will recompense for their works therein: they shall have nothing less therein than their deserts
  These are they for whom there is nothing in the next world but the Fire: all that they have wrought in this life shall come to nought, and vain shall be all their doings
  With such can they be compared who rest upon clear proofs from their Lord? to whom a witness from him reciteth the Koran, and who is preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy? These have faith in it: but the partisans of idolatry, who believe not in it, are menaced with the fire! Have thou no doubts about that Book, for it is the very truth from thy Lord
 But most men will not believe
  Who is guilty of a greater injustice than he who inventeth a lie concerning God? They shall be set before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, "These are they who made their Lord a liar
" Shall not the malison of God be on these unjust doers,  Who pervert others from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked, and believe not in a life to come? God's power on earth they shall not weaken; and beside God they have no protector! Doubled shall be their punishment! They were not able to hearken, and they could not see
  These are they who have lost their own souls, and the deities of their own devising have vanished from them:  There is no doubt but that in the next world they shall be the lost ones
  But they who shall have believed and done the things that are right, and humbled them before their Lord, shall be the inmates of Paradise; therein shall they abide for ever
  These two sorts of persons resemble the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing: shall these be compared as alike? Ah! do ye not comprehend?  We sent Noah of old unto his people:-"Verily I come to you a plain admonisher,  That ye worship none but God
 Verily I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day
"  Then said the chiefs of his people who believed not, "We see in thee but a man like ourselves; and we see not who have followed thee except our meanest ones of hasty judgment, nor see we any excellence in you above ourselves: nay, we deem you liars
"  He said: "O my people! how think you? If I am upon a clear revelation from my Lord, who hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself to which ye are blind, can we force it on you, if ye are averse from it?  And, O my people! I ask you not for riches: my reward is of God alone: and I will not drive away those who believe that they shall meet their Lord:-but I see that ye are an ignorant people
  And, O my people! were I to drive them away, who shall help me against God? Will ye not therefore consider?  And I tell you not that with me are the treasures of God: nor do I say, 'I know the things unseen;' nor do I say, 'I am an angel;' nor do I say of those whom you eye with scorn, No good thing will God bestow on them:-God best knoweth what is in their minds-for then should I be one of those who act unjustly
"  They said: "O Noah! already hast thou disputed with us, and multiplied disputes with us: Bring then upon us what thou hast threatened, if thou be of those who speak truth
"  He said, "God will bring it on you at His sole pleasure, and it is not you who can weaken him;  Nor, if God desire to mislead you, shall my counsel profit you, though I fain would counsel you aright
 He is your Lord, and unto Him shall ye be brought back
  Do they say, "This Koran is of his own devising?" Say: On me be my own guilt, if I have devised it, but I am clear of that whereof ye are guilty
  And it was revealed unto Noah
 Verily, none of thy people shall believe, save they who have believed already; therefore be not thou grieved at their doings
  But build the Ark under our eye and after our revelation: and plead not with me for the evil doers, for they are to be drowned
  So he built the Ark; and whenever the chiefs of his people passed by they laughed him to scorn:6 said he, "Though ye laugh at us, we truly shall laugh at you, even as ye laugh at us; and in the end ye shall know  On whom a punishment shall come that shall shame him, and on whom shall light a lasting punishment
"  Thus was it until our sentence came to pass, and the earth's surface7 boiled up
 We said, "Carry into it one pair of every kind, and thy family, except him on whom sentence hath before been passed, and those who have believed
" But there believed not with him except a few
  And he said, "Embark ye therein
 In the name of God be its course and its riding at anchor! Truly my Lord is right Gracious, Merciful
"  And the Ark moved on with them amid waves like mountains: and Noah called to his son-for he was apart-"Embark with us, O my child! and be not with the unbelievers
"  He said, "I will betake me to a mountain that shall secure me from the water
" He said, "None shall be secure this day from the decree of God, save him on whom He shall have mercy
" And a wave passed between them, and he was among the drowned
  And it was said, "O Earth! swallow up thy water;" and "cease, O Heaven!" And the water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, and the Ark rested upon Al- Djoudi;8 and it was said, "Avaunt! ye tribe of the wicked!"  And Noah called on his Lord and said, "O Lord! verily my son is of my family: and thy promise is true, and thou art the most just of judges
"  He said, "O Noah! verily, he is not of thy family: in this thou actest not aright
9 Ask not of me that whereof thou knowest nought: I warn thee that thou become not of the ignorant
  He said, "To thee verily, O my Lord, do I repair lest I ask that of thee wherein I have no knowledge: unless thou forgive me and be merciful to me I shall be one of the lost
  It was said to him, "O Noah! debark with peace from Us, and with blessings on thee and on peoples to be born from those who are with thee; but as for other and unbelieving peoples, we will give them their good things in this world, but hereafter shall a grievous punishment light on them from us
  This is one of the secret Histories: we reveal it unto thee: neither thou nor thy people knew it ere this: be patient thou: verily, there is a prosperous issue to the God-fearing
  And unto Ad we sent their Brother HOUD
 He said, "O my people, worship God
 You have no God beside Him
 Ye only devise a lie
  O my people! I ask of you no recompense for this: my recompense is with Him only who hath made me
 Will ye not then understand?  O my people! ask pardon of your Lord; then be turned unto Him: He will send down the heavens upon you with copious rains:  And with strength on strength will He increase you: only turn not back with deeds of evil
"  They said, "O Houd, thou hast not brought us proofs of thy mission: we will not abandon our gods at thy word, and we believe thee not
  We can only say that some of our gods have smitten thee with evil
" Said he, "Now take I God to witness, and do ye also witness, that I am clear of your joining other gods  To God
 Conspire then against me all of you, and delay me not
  For I trust in God, my Lord and yours
 No single beast is there which he holdeth not by its forelock
 Right, truly, is the way in which my Lord goeth
  But if ye turn back, I have already declared to you my message
 And my Lord will put another people in your place, nor shall ye at all hurt Him; verily, my Lord keepeth watch over all things
"  And when our doom came to be inflicted, we rescued Houd and those who had like faith with Him, by our special mercy: we rescued them from the rigorous chastisement
  These men of Ad gainsaid the signs of their Lord, and rebelled against his messengers, and followed the bidding of every proud contumacious person
  Followed therefore were they in this world by a curse; and in the day of the Resurrection it shall be said to them, "What! Did not Ad disbelieve their Lord?" Was not Ad, the people of Houd, cast far away?  And unto Themoud we sent their Brother Saleh:10-"O my people! said he, worship God: you have no other god than Him
 He hath raised you up out of the earth, and hath given you to dwell therein
 Ask pardon of him then, and be turned unto him; for thy Lord is nigh, ready to answer
"  They said, "O Saleh! our hopes were fixed on thee till now:11 forbiddest thou us to worship what our fathers worshipped? Truly we misdoubt the faith to which thou callest us, as suspicious
"  He said, "O my people! what think ye? If I have a revelation from my Lord to support me, and if He hath shewed his mercy on me, who could protect me from God if I rebel against him? Ye would only confer on me increase of ruin
  O my people! this is the she-Camel of God, and a sign unto you
 Let her go at large and feed in God's earth, and do her no harm, lest a speedy punishment overtake you
"  Yet they hamstrung her: then said he, "Yet three days more enjoy yourselves in your dwellings: this menace will not prove untrue
"  And when our sentence came to pass, we rescued Saleh and those who had a like faith with him, by our mercy, from ignominy on that day
 Verily, thy Lord is the Strong, the Mighty!  And a violent tempest overtook the wicked, and they were found in the morning prostrate in their dwellings,  As though they had never abode in them
 What! Did not Themoud disbelieve his Lord? Was not Themoud utterly cast off?  And our messengers came formerly to Abraham with glad tidings
 "Peace," said they
 He said, "Peace," and he tarried not, but brought a roasted calf
  And when he saw that their hands touched it not,12 he misliked them, and grew fearful of them
 They said, "Fear not, for we are sent to the people of Lot
"  His wife was standing by and laughed;13 and we announced Isaac to her; and after Isacc, Jacob
  She said, "Ah, woe is me! shall I bear a son when I am old, and when this my husband is an old man? This truly would be a marvellous thing
"  They said, "Marvellest thou at the command of God? God's mercy and blessing be upon you, O people of this house; praise and glory are His due!"  And when Abraham's fear had passed away, and these glad tidings had reached him, he pleaded with us for the people of Lot
 Verily, Abraham was right kind, pitiful, relenting
  "O Abraham! desist from this; for already hath the command of thy God gone forth; as for them, a punishment not to be averted is coming on them
"  And when our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved for them; and he was too weak to protect them,14 and he said, "This is a day of difficulty
"  And his people came rushing on towards him, for aforetime had they wrought this wickedness
 He said, "O my people! these my daughters will be purer for you: fear God, and put me not to shame in my guests
 Is there no rightminded man among you?"  They said, "Thou knowest now that we need not thy daughters; and thou well knowest what we require
"  He said, "Would that I had strength to resist you, or that I could find refuge with some powerful chieftain
"15  The Angels said, "O Lot! verily, we are the messengers of thy Lord: they shall not touch thee: depart with thy family in the dead of night, and let not one of you turn back: as for thy wife, on her shall light what shall light on them
 Verily, that with which they are threatened is for the morning
 Is not the morning near?"  And when our decree came to be executed we turned those cities upside down, and we rained down upon them blocks of claystone one after another, marked16 by thy Lord himself
 Nor are they far distant from the wicked Meccans
  And we sent to Madian17 their brother Shoaib
 He said, "O my people! worship God: no other God have you than He: give not short weight and measure: I see indeed that ye revel in good things; but I fear for you the punishment of the all-encompassing day
  O my people! give weight and measure with fairness; purloin not other men's goods; and perpetrate not injustice on the earth with corrupt practices:  A residue,18 the gift of God, will be best for you if ye are believers:  But I am not a guardian over you
"  They said to him, "O Shoaib! is it thy prayers which enjoin that we should leave what our fathers worshipped, or that we should not do with our substance as pleaseth us? Thou forsooth art the mild, the right director!"  He said, "O my people! How think ye? If I have a clear revelation from my Lord, and if from Himself He hath supplied me with goodly supplies, and if I will not follow you in that which I myself forbid you, do I seek aught but your amendment so far as in me lieth? My sole help is in God
 In Him do I trust, and to Him do I turn me
  O my people! let not your opposition to me draw down upon you the like of that which befel the people of Noah, or the people of Houd, or the people of Saleh: and the abodes of the people of Lot are not far distant from you!  Seek pardon of your Lord and be turned unto Him: verily, my Lord is Merciful, Loving
  They said, "O Shoaib! we understand not much of what thou sayest, and we clearly see that thou art powerless among us: were it not for thy family we would have surely stoned thee, nor couldest thou have prevailed against us
"  He said, "O my people! think ye more highly of my family than of God? Cast ye Him behind your back, with neglect? Verily, my Lord is round about your actions
  And, O my people! act with what power ye can for my hurt: I verily will act: and ye shall know  On whom shall light a punishment that shall disgrace him, and who is the liar
 Await ye; verily I will await with you
"  And when our decree came to pass, we delivered Shoaib and his companions in faith, by our mercy: And a violent tempest overtook the wicked, and in the morning they were found prostrate in their houses  As if they had never dwelt in them
 Was not Madian swept off even as Themoud had been swept off?  Of old sent we Moses with our signs and with incontestable power to Pharaoh, and to his nobles-who followed the behests of Pharaoh, and, unrighteous were Pharaoh's behests
  He shall head his people on the day of the Resurrection and cause them to descend into the fire: and wretched the descent by which they shall descend!  They were followed by a curse in this world; and in the day of the Resurrection, wretched the gift that shall be given them!  Such, the histories of the cities which we relate to thee
 Some of them are standing, others mown down:  We dealt not unfairly by them, but they dealt not fairly by themselves: and their gods on whom they called beside God availed them not at all when thy Lord's behest came to pass
 They did but increase their ruin
  Such was thy Lord's grasp19 when he laid that grasp on the cities that had been wicked
 Verily his grasp is afflictive, terrible!  Herein truly is a sign for him who feareth the punishment of the latter day
 That shall be a day unto which mankind shall be gathered together; that shall be a day witnessed by all creatures
  Nor do we delay it, but until a time appointed
  When that day shall come no one shall speak a word but by His leave, and some shall be miserable and others blessed
  And as for those who shall be consigned to misery-their place the Fire! therein shall they sigh and bemoan them-  Therein shall they abide while the Heavens and the Earth shall last, unless thy Lord shall will it otherwise; verily thy Lord doth what He chooseth
  And as for the blessed ones-their place the Garden! therein shall they abide while the Heavens and the Earth endure, with whatever imperishable boon thy Lord may please to add
  Have thou no doubts therefore concerning that which they worship: they worship but what their fathers worshipped before them: we will surely assign them their portion with nothing lacking
  Of old gave we Moses the Book, and they fell to variance about it
 If a decree of respite had not gone forth from thy Lord, there had surely been a decision between them
 Thy people also are in suspicious doubts about the Koran
  And truly thy Lord will repay every one according to their works! for He is well aware of what they do
  Go straight on then as thou hast been commanded, and he also who hath turned to God with thee, and let him transgress no more
 He beholdeth what ye do
  Lean not on the evil doers lest the Fire lay hold on you
 Ye have no protector, save God, and ye shall not be helped against Him
  And observe prayer at early morning, at the close of the day, and at the approach of night; for the good deeds drive away the evil deeds
 This is a warning for those who reflect:  And persevere steadfastly, for verily God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish
  Were the generations before you, endued with virtue, and who forbad corrupt doings on the earth, more than a few of those whom we delivered? but the evil doers followed their selfish pleasures, and became transgressors
  And thy Lord was not one who would destroy those cities unjustly, when its inhabitants were righteous
  Had thy Lord pleased he would have made mankind of one religion: but those only to whom thy Lord hath granted his mercy will cease to differ
 And unto this hath He created them; for the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled, "I will wholly fill hell with Djinn and men
"  And all that we have related to thee of the histories of these Apostles, is to confirm thy heart thereby
 By these hath the truth reached thee, and a monition and warning to those who believe
  But say to those who believe not, "Act as ye may and can: we will act our part: and wait ye; we verily will wait
"  To God belong the secret things of the Heavens and of the Earth: all things return to him: worship him then and put thy trust in Him: thy Lord is not regardless of your doings

-52 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ELIF
 LAM
 RA
 This Book have we sent down to thee that by their Lord's permission thou mayest bring men out of darkness into light, into the path of the Mighty, the Glorious-  Of God; to whom belongeth whatever is in the Heavens and whatever is on the Earth: and woe! for their terrible punishment, to the infidels,  Who love the life that now is, above that which is to come, and mislead from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked
 These are in a far-gone error
  And in order that He might speak plainly to them, we have not sent any Apostle, save with the speech of his own people; but God misleadeth whom He will, and whom He will he guideth: and He is the Mighty, the Wise
  Of old did we send Moses with our signs: and said to him, "Bring forth thy people from the darkness into the light, and remind them of the days of God
" Verily, in this are signs for every patient, grateful person:  When Moses said to his people, "Remember the kindness of God to you, when he rescued you from the family of Pharaoh who laid on you a cruel affliction, slaughtering your male children, and suffering only your females to live
" In this was a sore trial from your Lord-  And when your Lord caused it to be heard that, "If we render thanks then will I surely increase you more and more: but if ye be thankless
 
 
 
  Verily, right terrible my chastisement
"  And Moses said, "If ye and all who are on the Earth be thankless, yet truly God is passing Rich, and worthy of all praise
"  Hath not the story reached you of those who were before you, the people of Noah, and Ad, and Themoud,  And of those who lived after them? None knoweth them but God
 When their prophets came to them with proofs of their mission, they put their hands on their mouths and said, "In sooth, we believe not your message; and in sooth, of that to which you bid us, we are in doubt, as of a thing suspicious
"  Their prophets said: "Is there any doubt concerning God, maker of the Heavens and of the Earth, who calleth you that He may pardon your sins, and respite you until an appointed time?"  They said, "Ye are but men like us: fain would ye turn us from our fathers' worship
 Bring us therefore some clear proof
"  Their Apostles said to them, "We are indeed but men like you
 But God bestoweth favours on such of his servants as he pleaseth, and it is not in our power to bring you any special proof,  But by the leave of God
 In God therefore let the faithful trust
  And why should we not put our trust in God, since He hath already guided us in our ways
 We will certainly bear with constancy the harm you would do to us
 In God let the trustful trust
"  And they who believed not said to their Apostles, "Forth from our land will we surely drive you, or, to our religion shall ye return
" Then their Lord revealed to them, "We will certainly destroy the wicked doers,  And we shall certainly cause you to dwell in the land after them
 This for him who dreadeth the appearance at my judgment-seat and who dreadeth my menace!"  Then sought they help from God, and every proud rebellious one perished:  Hell is before him: and of tainted water shall he be made to drink:  He shall sup it and scarce swallow it for loathing; and Death shall assail him on every side, but he shall not die: and before him shall be seen a grievous torment
  A likeness of those who believe not in their Lord
 Their works are like ashes which the wind scattereth on a stormy day: no advantage shall they gain from their works
 This is the far-gone wandering
  Seest thou not that in truth1 hath God created the Heavens and the Earth? Were such his pleasure He could make you pass away, and cause a new creation to arise
  And this would not be hard for God
  All mankind shall come forth before God; and the weak shall say to the men of might, "Verily, we were your followers: will ye not then relieve us of some part of the vengeance of God?"  They shall say, "If God had guided us, we surely had guided you
 It is now all one whether we be impatient, or endure with patience
 We have no escape
"  And after doom hath been given, Satan shall say, "Verily, God promised you a promise of truth: I, too, made you a promise, but I deceived you
 Yet I had no power over you:  But I only called you and ye answered me
 Blame not me then, but blame yourselves: I cannot aid you, neither can ye aid me
 I never believed that I was His equal with whom ye joined me
"2 As for the evil doers, a grievous torment doth await them
  But they who shall have believed and done the things that be right, shall be brought into gardens beneath which the rivers flow: therein shall they abide for ever by the permission of their Lord: their greeting therein shall be "Peace
"  Seest thou not to what God likeneth a good word?3 To a good tree: its root firmly fixed, and its branches in the Heaven:  Yielding its fruit in all seasons by the will of its Lord
 God setteth forth these similitudes to men that haply they may reflect
  And an evil word is like an evil tree torn up from the face of the earth, and without strength to stand
  Those who believe shall God stablish by his steadfast word both in this life and in that which is to come: but the wicked shall He cause to err: God doth his pleasure
  Hast thou not beholden those who repay the goodness of God with infidelity, and sink their people into the abode of perdition-  Hell? Therein shall they be burned; and wretched the dwelling!  They set up compeers with God in order to mislead man from his way
 SAY: Enjoy your pleasures yet awhile, but assuredly, your going hence shall be into the fire
  Speak to my servants who have believed, that they observe prayer, and give alms of that with which we have supplied them, both privately and openly, ere the day come when there shall be neither traffic nor friendship
  It is God who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, and sendeth down water from the Heaven, and so bringeth forth the fruits for your food: And He hath subjected to you the ships, so that by His command, they pass through the sea; and He hath subjected the rivers to you: and He hath subjected to you the sun and the moon in their constant courses: and He hath subjected the day and the night to you: of everything which ye ask Him, giveth He to you; and if ye would reckon up the favours of God, ye cannot count them! Surely man is unjust, ungrateful!  ABRAHAM said, "O Lord make this land secure, and turn aside me and my children from serving idols:  For many men, O my Lord, have they led astray
 But whosoever shall follow me, he truly shall be of me; and whosoever shall disobey me
 
 
 
  Thou truly art Gracious, Merciful
  O our Lord! verily I have settled some of my offspring in an unfruitful valley, nigh to thy holy house;4 O our Lord, that they may strictly observe prayer! Make thou therefore the hearts of men to yearn toward them, and supply them with fruits that they may be thankful
  O our Lord! thou truly knowest what we hide and what we bring to light; nought on earth or in heaven is hidden from God
 Praise be to God who hath given me, in my old age, Ismael and Isaac! My Lord is the hearer of prayer
  Lord! grant that I and my posterity may observe prayer
 O our Lord! and grant this my petition
 O our Lord! forgive me and my parents and the faithful, on the day wherein account shall be taken
"  Think thou not that God is regardless of the deeds of the wicked
 He only respiteth them to the day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror:  They hasten forward in fear; their heads upraised in supplication; their looks riveted; and their hearts a blank
 Warn men therefore of the day when the punishment shall overtake them,  And when the evil doers shall say, "O our Lord! respite us yet a little while:5  To thy call will we make answer; thine Apostles will we follow
" "Did ye not once swear that no change should befal you?  Yet ye dwelt in the dwellings of those6 who were the authors of their undoing7 and it was made plain to you how we had dealt with them; and we held them up to you as examples
 They plotted their plots: but God could master their plots, even though their plots had been so powerful as to move the mountains
"  Think not then that God will fail his promise to his Apostles: aye! God is mighty, and Vengeance is His
  On the day when the Earth shall be changed into another Earth, and the Heavens also, men shall come forth unto God, the Only, the Victorious
  And thou shalt see the wicked on that day linked together in chains-  Their garments of pitch, and fire shall enwrap their faces that God may reward every soul as it deserveth; verily God is prompt to reckon
  This is a message for mankind, that they may thereby be warned: and that they may know that there is but one God; and that men of understanding may ponder it

-JOSEPH, PEACE BE ON HIM [LXXVII
]  MECCA
-III Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ELIF
 LAM
 RA
1 These are signs of the clear Book
  An Arabic Koran have we sent it down, that ye might understand it
  In revealing to thee this Koran,2 one of the most beautiful of narratives will we narrate to thee, of which thou hast hitherto been regardless
  When Joseph said to his Father, "O my Father! verily I beheld eleven stars and the sun and the moon-beheld them make obeisance to me!"3  He said, "O my son! tell not thy vision to thy brethren, lest they plot a plot against thee: for Satan is the manifest foe of man
  It is thus that thy Lord shall choose thee and will teach thee the interpretation of dark saying, and will perfect his favours on thee and on the family of Jacob, as of old he perfected it on thy fathers Abraham and Isaac; verily thy Lord is Knowing, Wise!"  Now in JOSEPH and his brethren are signs for the enquirers;4  When they said, "Surely better loved by our Father, than we, who are more in number, is Joseph and his brother; verily, our father hath clearly erred
  Slay ye Joseph! or drive him to some other land, and on you alone shall your father's face be set! and after this, ye shall live as upright persons
"  One of them said, "Slay not Joseph, but cast him down to the bottom of the well: if ye do so, some wayfarers will take him up
"  They said, "O our Father! why dost thou not entrust us with Joseph? indeed we mean him well
  Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and sport: we will surely keep him safely
"  He said, "Verily, your taking him away will grieve me; and I fear lest while ye are heedless of him the wolf devour him
"  They said, "Surely if the wolf devour him, and we so many, we must in that case be weak indeed
"5  And when they went away with him they agreed to place him at the bottom of the well
 And We revealed to him, "Thou wilt yet tell them of this their deed, when they shall not know thee
"  And they came at nightfall to their father weeping
  They said, "O our Father! of a truth, we went to run races, and we left Joseph with our clothes, and the wolf devoured him: but thou wilt not believe us even though we speak the truth
"  And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it
 He said, "Nay, but yourselves have managed this affair
6 But patience is seemly: and the help of God is to be implored that I may bear what you tell me
"  And wayfarers came and sent their drawer of water,7 and he let down his bucket
 "Good news!"8 said he, "This is a youth!" And they kept his case secret, to make merchandise of him
 But God knew what they did
  And they sold him for a paltry price-for some dirhems counted down, and at no high rate did they value him
  And he who bought him-an Egyptian-said to his wife, "Treat him hospitably; haply he may be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son
" Thus did we settle Joseph in the land, and we instructed him in the interpretation of dark sayings, for God is equal to his purpose; but most men know it not
  And when he had reached his age of strength we bestowed on him judgment and knowledge; for thus do we recompense the well doers
  And she in whose house he was conceived a passion for him, and she shut the doors and said, "Come hither
" He said, "God keep me! Verily, my lord hath given me a good home: and the injurious shall not prosper
"  But she longed for him; and he had longed for her had he not seen a token from his lord
9 Thus we averted evil and defilement from him, for he was one of our sincere servants
  And they both made for the door, and she rent his shirt behind; and at the door they met her lord
 "What," said she, "shall be the recompense of him who would do evil to thy family, but a prison10 or a sore punishment?"  He said, "She solicited me to evil
" And a witness out of her own family11 witnessed: "If his shirt be rent in front she speaketh truth, and he is a liar:  But if his shirt be rent behind, she lieth and he is true
"  And when his lord saw his shirt torn behind, he said, "This is one of your devices! verily your devices are great!  Joseph! leave this affair
 And thou, O wife, ask pardon for thy crime, for thou hast sinned
"  And in the city, the women said, "The wife of the Prince hath solicited her servant: he hath fired her with his love: but we clearly see her manifest error
"  And when she heard of their cabal, she sent to them and got ready a banquet for them, and gave each one of them a knife, and said, "Joseph shew thyself to them
" And when they saw him they were amazed at him, and cut their hands,12 and said, "God keep us! This is no man! This is no other than a noble angel!"  She said, "This is he about whom ye blamed me
 I wished him to yield to my desires, but he stood firm
 But if he obey not my command, he shall surely be cast into prison, and become one of the despised
"  He said, "O my Lord! I prefer the prison to compliance with their bidding: but unless thou turn away their snares from me, I shall play the youth with them, and become one of the unwise
"  And his Lord heard him and turned aside their snares from him: for he is the Hearer, the Knower
  Yet resolved they, even after they had seen the signs of his innocence, to imprison him for a time
  And there came into the prison with him two youths
 Said one of them, "Methought in my dream that I was pressing grapes
" And the other said, "I dreamed that I was carrying bread on my head, of which the birds did eat
 Declare to us the interpretation of this, for we see thou art a virtuous person
"  He said, "There shall not come to you in a dream any food wherewith ye shall be fed, but I will acquaint you with its interpretation ere it come to pass to you
 This is a part of that which my Lord hath taught me: for I have abandoned the religion13 of those who believe not in God and who deny the life to come;  And I follow the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
 We may not associate aught with God
 This is of God's bounty towards us and towards mankind: but the greater part of mankind are not thankful
  O my two fellow prisoners! are sundry lords best, or God, the One, the Mighty?  Ye worship beside him mere names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which God hath not sent down any warranty
 Judgment belongeth to God alone
 He hath bidden you worship none but Him
 This is the right faith: but most men know it not
  O my two fellow prisoners! as to one of you, he will serve wine unto his Lord: but as to the other, he will be crucified and the birds shall eat from off his head
 The matter is decreed concerning which ye enquire
"  And he said unto him who he judged would be set at large, "Remember me with thy lord
" But Satan caused him to forget the remembrance of his Lord,14 so he remained some years in prison
  And the King said, "Verily, I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean devoured; and seven green ears and other withered
 O nobles, teach me my vision, if a vision ye are able to expound
"  They said, "They are confused dreams, nor know we aught of the unravelling of dreams
"  And he of the twain who had been set at large, said, "I will tell you the interpretation; let me go for it
"  "Joseph, man of truth! teach us of the seven fat kine which seven lean devoured, and of the seven green ears, and other withered, that I may return to the men, and that they may be informed
"  He said, "Ye shall sow seven years as is your wont, and the corn which ye reap leave ye in its ear, except a little of which ye shall eat
  Then after that shall come seven grievous years which shall eat what ye have stored for them, except a little which ye shall have kept
  Then shall come after this a year, in which men shall have rain, and in which they shall press the grape
"  And the King said, "Bring him to me
"15 And when the messenger came to Joseph he said, "Go back to thy lord, and ask him what meant the women who cut their hands, for my lord well knoweth the snare they laid
"  Then said the Prince to the women, "What was your purpose when ye solicited Joseph?" They said, "God keep us! we know not any ill of him
" The wife of the Prince said, "Now doth the truth appear
 It was I who would have led him into unlawful love, and he is one of the truthful
"  "By this" (said Joseph) "may my lord know that I did not in his absence play him false, and that God guideth not the machinations of deceivers
  Yet I hold not myself clear, for the heart is prone to evil, save theirs on whom my Lord hath mercy; for gracious is my Lord, Merciful
"  And the King said, "Bring him to me: I will take him for my special service
" And when he had spoken with him he said, "From this day shalt thou be with us, invested with place and trust
"  He said, "Set me over the granaries of the land,16 I will be their prudent keeper!"  Thus did we stablish Joseph in the land that he might house himself therein at pleasure
 We bestow our favours on whom we will, and suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish
  And truly the recompense of the life to come is better, for those who have believed and feared God
  And Joseph's brethren came and went in to him and he knew them, but they recognised him not
  And when he had provided them with their provision, he said, "Bring me your brother from your father
 See ye not that I fill the measure, and am the best of hosts?  But if ye bring him not to me, then no measure of corn shall there be for you from me, nor shall ye come near me
"  They said, "We will ask him of his father, and we will surely do it
"  Said he to his servants, "Put their money into their camel-packs, that they may perceive it when they have returned to their family: haply they will come back to us
"  And when they returned to their father, they said, "O, our father! corn is withholden from us: send, therefore, our brother with us and we shall have our measure; and all care of him will we take
"  He said, "Shall I entrust you with him otherwise than as I before entrusted you with his brother? But God is the best guardian, and of those who shew compassion He is the most compassionate
"  And when they opened their goods they found their money had been returned to them
 They said, "O, our father, what more can we desire? Here is our money returned to us; we will provide corn for our families, and will take care of our brother, and shall receive a camel's burden more of corn
 This is an easy quantity
"17  He said, "I will not send him with you but on your oath before God that ye will, indeed, bring him back to me, unless hindrances encompass you
" And when they had given him their pledge, he said, "God is witness of what we say
"  And he said, "O, my sons! Enter not by one gate, but enter by different gates
18 Yet can I not help you against aught decreed by God: judgment belongeth to God alone
 In Him put I my trust, and in Him let the trusting trust
"  And when they entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avert from them anything decreed of God; but it only served to satisfy a desire in the soul of Jacob which he had charged them to perform; for he was possessed of knowledge which we had taught him; but most men have not that knowledge
  And when they came in to Joseph, he took his brother to him
 He said, "Verily, I am thy brother
 Be not thou grieved for what they did
"19  And when he had provided them with their provisions, he placed his drinking cup in his brother's camel-pack
 Then a crier cried after them, "O travellers! ye are surely thieves
"  They turned back to them and said, "What is that ye miss?"  "We miss," said they, "the prince's cup
 For him who shall restore it, a camel's load of corn! I pledge myself for it
"  They said, "By God! ye know certainly that we came not to do wrong20 in the land and we have not been thieves
"  "What," said the Egyptians, "shall be the recompense of him who hath stolen it, if ye be found liars?"  They said, "That he in whose camel-pack it shall be found be given up to you in satisfaction for it
 Thus recompense we the unjust
"  And Joseph began with their sacks, before the sack of his brother, and then from the sack of his brother he drew it out
 This stratagem did we suggest to Joseph
 By the King's law he had no power to seize his brother, had not God pleased
 We uplift into grades of wisdom whom we will
 And there is one knowing above every one else endued with knowledge
  They said, "If he steal, a brother of his hath stolen heretofore
"21 But Joseph kept his secret, and did not discover it to them
 Said he, aside, "Ye are in the worse condition
 And God well knoweth what ye state
"  They said, "O Prince! Verily he hath a very aged father; in his stead, therefore, take one of us, for we see that thou art a generous person
"  He said, "God forbid that we should take but him with whom our property was found, for then should we act unjustly
"  And when they despaired of Benjamin, they went apart for counsel
 The eldest of them said, "Know ye not how that your father hath taken a pledge from you before God, and how formerly ye failed in duty with regard to Joseph? I will not quit the land till my father give me leave, or God decide for me; for of those who decide is He the best
  Return ye to your father and say, 'O our father! Verily, thy son hath stolen: we bear witness only of what we know: we could not guard against the unforeseen
  Enquire for thyself in the city where we have been, and of the caravan with which we have arrived; and we are surely speakers of the truth
'  He said, "Nay, ye have arranged all this among yourselves: But patience is seemly: God, may be, will bring them back to me together; for he is the Knowing, the Wise
"  And he turned away from them and said, "Oh! how I am grieved for Joseph!" and his eyes became white with grief, for he bore a silent sorrow
  They said, "By God thou wilt only cease to think of Joseph when thou art at the point of death, or dead
"  He said, "I only plead my grief and my sorrow to God: but I know from God what ye know not:22  Go, my sons, and seek tidings of Joseph and his brother, and despair not of God's mercy, for none but the unbelieving despair of the mercy of God
"  And when they came in to Joseph, they said, "O Prince, distress hath reached us and our family, and little is the money that we have brought
 But give us full measure, and bestow it as alms, for God will recompense the almsgivers
"  He said, "Know ye what ye did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?"  They said, "Canst thou indeed be Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my brother
 Now hath God been gracious to us
 For whoso feareth God and endureth
 
 
 
  God verily will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish!"  They said, "By God! now hath God chosen thee above us, and we have indeed been sinners!"  He said, "No blame be on you this day
 God will forgive you, for He is the most merciful of those who shew mercy
  Go ye with this my shirt and throw it on my father's face, and he shall recover his sight: and bring me all your family
"  And when the caravan was departed, their father said, "I surely perceive the smell of Joseph:23 think ye that I dote?"  They said, "By God, it is thy old mistake
"  And when the bearer of good tidings came, he cast it on his face, and Jacob's eyesight returned
"  Then he said, "Did I not tell you that I knew from God what ye knew not?"  They said, "Our father, ask pardon for our crimes for us, for we have indeed been sinners
"  He said, "I will ask your pardon of my Lord, for he is Gracious, Merciful
"  And when they came into Joseph he took his parents24 to him, and said, "Enter ye Egypt, if God will, secure
"  And he raised his parents to the seat of state, and they fell down bowing themselves unto him
 Then said he, "O my father, this is the meaning of my dream of old
 My Lord hath now made it true, and he hath surely been gracious to me, since he took me forth from the prison, and hath brought you up out of the desert, after that Satan had stirred up strife between me and my brethren; for my Lord is gracious to whom He will; for He is the Knowing, the Wise
  O my Lord, thou hast given me dominion, and hast taught me to expound dark sayings
 Maker of the Heavens and of the Earth! My guardian art thou in this world and in the next! Cause thou me to die a Muslim, and join me with the just
"  This is one of the secret histories25 which we reveal unto thee
 Thou wast not present with Joseph's brethren when they conceived their design and laid their plot: but the greater part of men, though thou long for it, will not believe
  Thou shalt not ask of them any recompense for this message
 It is simply an instruction for all mankind
  And many as are the signs in the Heavens and on the Earth, yet they will pass them by, and turn aside from them:  And most of them believe not in God, without also joining other deities with Him
  What! Are they sure that the overwhelming chastisement of God shall not come upon them, or that that Hour shall not come upon them suddenly, while they are unaware?  SAY: This is my way: resting on a clear proof, I call you to God, I and whoso followeth me: and glory be to God! I am not one of those who add other deities to Him
  Never before thee have we sent any but men, chosen out of the people of the cities, to whom we made revelations
 Will they not journey through the land, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? But the mansions of the next life shall be better for those who fear God
 Will they not then comprehend?  When at last the Apostles lost all hope, and deemed that they were reckoned as liars, our aid reached them, and we delivered whom we would; but our vengeance was not averted from the wicked
  Certainly in their histories is an example for men of understanding
 This is no new tale of fiction, but a confirmation of previous scriptures, and an explanation of all things, and guidance and mercy to those who believe

-THE BELIEVER [LXXVIII
]  MECCA
-85 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  HA
 MIM
 The Revelation (sending down) of the Book is from God the Almighty, the All-knowing,1  Forgiver of sin, and receiver of penitence,-vehement in chastisement,  Long-suffering! There is no God but He: to Him shall be the final gathering
  None but infidels gainsay the signs of God: but let not their prosperity in the land deceive thee
  The people of Noah, and the confederates after them, have brought the charge of imposture before these Meccans: each nation schemed against their apostle to lay violent hold on him, and disputed with vain words to refute the truth
 Therefore did I lay violent hold on them; and how great was my chastisement!  Thus is it that thy Lord's sentence, that inmates shall they be of the fire, was accomplished upon the infidels
  They who bear the throne2 and they who encircle it, celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him, and implore forgiveness for the believers:-"O our Lord! thou embracest all things in mercy and knowledge; forgive, therefore, those who turn to thee and follow thy path; keep them from the pains of hell:  O our Lord! and bring them into the Gardens of Eden which thou hast promised to them, and to the righteous ones of their fathers and their wives and their children; for thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise:  And keep them from evil: for on him hast thou mercy whom on that day thou shalt keep from evil;" and this will be the great felicity
  But to the infidels shall a voice cry, "Surely the hatred of God is more grievous than your hatred of yourselves, when ye were called to the faith, and remained unbelievers
"  They shall say, "Twice, O our Lord, hast thou given us death, and twice hast thou given us life:3 and we acknowledge our sins: is there no way to escape?"  "This hath befallen you, for that when One God was proclaimed to you, ye believed not: but when partners had been united with him, ye believed: But judgment belongeth unto God, the High, the Great
"  It is He who sheweth you his signs, and sendeth down supplies to you from Heaven: but none will receive warning save he who turneth to God
  Call then on God, offering him a pure worship, though the infidels abhor it
  Of exalted grade, of the throne possessed, He sendeth forth the Spirit at His own behest on whomsoever of His servants He pleaseth, that He may warn of the day of meeting,  The day when they shall come forth from their graves, when nought that concerneth them shall be hidden from God
 With whom shall be the power supreme on that day? With God, the One, the Almighty
  On that day shall every soul be recompensed as it hath deserved: no injustice on that day! Verily, God will be swift to reckon
  Warn them, then, of the approaching day, when men's hearts shall rise up, choking them, into their throats
  The evil-doers shall have no friend or intercessor who shall prevail
  God knoweth the deceitful of eye, and what men's breasts conceal
  And everything will God decide with truth: But nothing shall those gods whom men call on beside him, decide
 Verily, God! the Hearer, the Beholder, He!  Have they never journeyed in this land, and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them? Mightier were they in strength than these Meccans, and their traces remain in the land: Yet God took them in their sins, and there was none to defend them against God
  This, because their apostles had come to them with proofs of their mission, and they believed not: so God took them in hand; for He is mighty, vehement in punishing
  Moreover we had sent Moses of old with our signs and with clear authority
  To Pharaoh, and Haman, and Karun:4 and they said, "Sorcerer, impostor
"  And when he came to them from our presence with the truth, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe as he doth, and save their females alive;" but the stratagem of the unbelievers issued only in failure
  And Pharaoh said, "Let me alone, that I may kill Moses; and let him call upon his Lord: I fear lest he change your religion, or cause disorder to shew itself in the land
"  And Moses said, "I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every proud one who believeth not in the day of reckoning
"  And a man of the family of Pharaoh, who was a BELIEVER,5 but hid his faith, said, "Will ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when he hath already come to you with proofs of his mission from your Lord? and if he be a liar, on him will be his lie:6 but if he be a man of truth, part at least of what he threateneth will fall upon you
 Truly God guideth not him who is a transgressor, a liar
  O my people! this day is the kingdom yours, the eminent of the earth! but who shall defend us from the vengeance of God if it come on us?" Pharaoh said, "I would have you see only what I see; and in a right way only will I guide you
"  Then said he who believed, "O my people! truly I fear for you the like of the day of the allies,7  The like of the state of the people of Noah and Ad and Themoud,  And of those who came after them; yet God willeth not injustice to his servants
  And, O my people! I indeed fear for you the day of mutual outcry-  The day when ye shall be turned back from the Judgment into hell
 No protector shall ye have then against God
 And he whom God shall mislead no guide shall there be for him
  Moreover, Joseph had come to you before with clear tokens, but ye ceased not to doubt of the message with which he came to you, until when he died, ye said, 'God will by no means raise up an apostle after him
' " Thus God misleadeth him who is the transgressor, the doubter
  They who gainsay the signs of God without authority having come to them, are greatly hated by God and by those who believe
 Thus God sealeth up every proud, contumacious heart
  And Pharaoh said, "O Haman,8 Build for me a tower that I may reach the avenues,  The avenues of the heavens, and may mount to the God of Moses, for I verily deem him a liar
"  And thus the evil of his doings was made fair-seeming to Pharaoh, and he turned away from the path of truth; but the artifice of Pharaoh ended only in his ruin
  And he who believed said, "O my people! follow me: into the right way will I guide you
  O my people! this present life is only a passing joy, but the life to come is the mansion that abideth
  Whoso shall have wrought evil shall not be recompensed but with its like; but whoso shall have done the things that are right, whether male or female, and is a believer-these shall enter paradise: good things unreckoned shall they enjoy therein
  And, O my people! how is it that I bid you to salvation, but that ye bid me to the fire?  Ye invite me to deny God, and to join with him gods of whom I know nothing; but I invite you to the Mighty, the Forgiving
  No doubt is there that they to whom ye invite me are not to be invoked either in this world or in the world to come: and that unto God is our return, and that the transgressors shall be the inmates of the fire
  Then shall ye remember what I am saying unto you: and to God commit I my case: Verily, God beholdeth his servants
"  So God preserved him from the evils which they had planned, and the woe of the punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh
  It is the fire to which they shall be exposed morning and evening, and on the day when "the Hour" shall arrive-"Bring in the people of Pharaoh into the severest punishment
"  And when they shall wrangle together in the fire, the weak shall say to those who had borne themselves so proudly, "It is you we followed: will ye therefore relieve us from aught of the fire?"  And those proud ones shall say, "Verily we are all in it; for now hath God judged between his servants
"  And they who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of Hell, "Implore your Lord that he would give us ease but for one day from this torment
"  They shall say, "Came not your apostles to you with the tokens?" They shall say, "Yes
" They shall say, "Cry ye then aloud for help:" but the cry of the unbelievers shall be only in vain
  Assuredly, in this present life will we succour our apostles and those who shall have believed, and on the day when the witnesses shall stand forth;  A day whereon the plea of the evil doers shall not avail them; but theirs shall be a curse, and theirs the woe of the abode in Hell
  And of old gave we Moses the guidance, and we made the children of Israel the heritors of the Book,-a guidance and warning to men endued with understanding
  Therefore be steadfast thou and patient; for true is the promise of God: and seek pardon for thy fault,9 and celebrate the praise of thy Lord at evening and at morning
  As to those who cavil at the signs of God without authority having reached them, nought is there but pride in their breasts: but they shall not succeed
 Fly thou for refuge then to God, for He is the Hearer, the Beholder
  Greater surely than the creation of man is the creation of the heavens and of the earth: but most men know it not
  Moreover, the blind and the seeing, and the evil doer and they who believe and do the things that are right, shall not be deemed equal
 How few ponder this!  Aye, "the Hour" will surely come: there is no doubt of it: but most men believe it not
  And your Lord saith, "Call upon me-I will hearken unto you: but they who turn in disdain from my service shall enter Hell with shame
"  It is God who hath ordained the night for your rest, and the day to give you light: verily God is rich in bounties to men: but most men render not the tribute of thanks
  This is God your Lord, Creator of all things: no god is there but He: why then do ye turn away from Him?  Yet thus are they turned aside who gainsay the signs of God
  It is God who hath given you the earth as a sure foundation, and over it built up the Heaven, and formed you, and made your forms beautiful, and feedeth you with good things
 This is God your Lord
 Blessed then be God the Lord of the Worlds!  He is the Living One
 No God is there but He
 Call then upon Him and offer Him a pure worship
 Praise be to God the Lord of the Worlds!  SAY: Verily I am forbidden to worship what ye call on beside God, after that the clear tokens have come to me from my Lord, and I am bidden to surrender myself to the Lord of the Worlds
  He it is who created you of the dust, then of the germs of life, then of thick blood, then brought you forth infants: then he letteth you reach your full strength, and then become old men (but some of you die first), and reach the ordained term
 And this that haply ye may understand
  It is He who giveth life and death; and when He decreeth a thing, He only saith of it, "Be," and it is
  Seest thou not those who cavil at the signs of God? how are they turned aside!  They who treat "the Book," and the message with which we have sent our Sent Ones, as a lie, shall know the truth hereafter,  When the collars shall be on their necks and the chains to drag them into Hell: then in the fire shall they be burned
  Then shall it be said to them, "Where are they whom ye made the objects of joint worship with God?" They shall say, "They have vanished away from us
 Yea, it was nought on which we called heretofore
" Thus God leadeth the unbelievers astray
  -"This for you, because of your unrighteous insolence and immoderate joys on earth
  Enter ye the portals of Hell to abide therein for ever
 And, wretched the abode of the haughty ones!"  Therefore be thou steadfast in patience: for the promise of God is truth: and whether we shall make thee see part of the woes with which we threatened them, or whether we cause thee first to die, unto us shall they be brought back
  And we have already sent apostles before thee: of some we have told thee, and of others we have told thee nothing:10 but no apostle had the power to work a miracle unless by the leave of God
 But when God's behest cometh, everything will be decided with truth: and then they perish who treated it as a vain thing
  It is God who hath given you the cattle that on some of them ye may ride, and of some may eat:  (Other advantages too do ye derive from them)-and that by them ye may effect the projects ye cherish in your breasts; for on them, and on ships are ye borne:  And He sheweth you His signs: which, then, of the signs of God will ye deny?  Have they not journeyed in this land, and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them? More were they than these in number and mightier in strength, and greater are the traces of their power remaining in the land:11 yet their labours availed them nothing
  And when their apostles had come to them with the tokens of their mission, they exulted in what they possessed of knowledge; but that retribution at which they scoffed, encompassed them
  And when they beheld our vengeance they said, "We believe in God alone, and we disbelieve in the deities we once associated with Him
"  But their faith, after they had witnessed our vengeance, profited them not
 Such the procedure of God with regard to his servants who flourished of old
 And then the unbelievers perished

  11 The wealth of Mecca, although it still numbered about 12,000 inhabitants (as well as of Arabia generally), had much declined at the time of Muhammad, owing mainly to the navigation of the Red Sea, under the Roman dominion over Egypt, which of course impoverished the tribes situated on the line of the old mercantile route southward

1 These are the signs of the lucid Book
  We will recite to thee portions of the History of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for the teaching of the faithful
  Now Pharaoh lifted himself up in the earth, and divided his people into parties: one portion of them he brought low-He slew their male children, and let their females only live; for he was one of those who wrought disorders
  And we were minded to shew favour to those who were brought low in the land, and to make them spiritual chiefs,2 and to make them Pharaoh's heirs,  And to stablish them in the land;3 and to make Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts, the eye-witnesses of what they dreaded from them
  And we said by revelation to the mother of Moses, "Give him suck; and if thou fearest for him, launch him on the sea; and fear not, neither fret; for we will restore him to thee, and make him one of the apostles
"  And Pharaoh's family took him up to be a foe and a sorrow to them, for sinners were Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts!  And Pharaoh's wife said, "Joy of the eye4 to me and thee! put him not to death: haply he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son
" But they knew not what they did
  And the heart of Moses' mother became a blank through fear: and almost had she discovered him, but that we girt up her heart with constancy, in order that she might be one of those who believe
  She said to his sister, "Follow him
" And she watched him from afar: and they perceived it not
  And we caused him to refuse the nurses,5 until his sister came and said, Shall I point out to you the family of a house that will rear him for you, and will be careful of him?  So we restored him to his mother, to be the joy of her eyes, and that she might not fret, and that she might know that the promise of God was true
 But most men knew it not
  And when he had reached his age of strength, and had become a man, we bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge; for thus do we reward the righteous
  And he entered a city at the time when its inhabitants would not observe him,6 and found therein two men fighting: the one, of his own people; the other, of his enemies
 And he who was of his own people asked his help against him who was of his enemies
 And Moses smote him with his fist and slew him
 Said he, "This is a work of Satan; for he is an enemy, a manifest misleader
"  He said, "O my Lord, I have sinned to mine own hurt:7 forgive me
" So God forgave him; for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful
  He said, "Lord, because thou hast showed me this grace, I will never again be the helper of the wicked
"  And in the city at noon he was full of fear, casting furtive glances round him: and lo! the man whom he had helped the day before, cried out to him again for help
 Said Moses to him, "Thou art plainly a most depraved person
"  And when he would have laid violent hands on him who was their common foe, he said to him, "O Moses, dost thou desire to slay me, as thou slayedst a man yesterday? Thou desirest only to become a tyrant in this land, and desirest not to become a peacemaker
"  But a man came running up from the city's end
 He said, "O Moses, of a truth, the nobles consult to slay thee-Begone then-I counsel thee as a friend
"  So forth he went from it in fear, looking warily about him
 He said, "O Lord, deliver me from the unjust people
"  And when he was journeying toward Madian, he said, "Haply my Lord will direct me in an even path
"  And when he arrived at the water of Madian, he found at it a company of men watering
  And he found beside them, two women8 keeping back their flock: "Why do ye," said he, "thus?" They said "We shall not water till the shepherds shall have driven off; for our father is very aged
"  So he watered for them-then retired to the shade and said, "O my Lord, of the good thou hast caused me to meet with I stand in need
"9  And one of them came to him, walking bashfully
 Said she, "My father calleth thee, that he may pay thee wages for thy watering for us
" And when he came to him and had told him his STORY, "Fear not," said he, "thou hast escaped from an unjust people
"  One of them said, "O my father, hire him: for the best thou canst hire is the strong, the trusty
"  He said, "Truly to one of these my two daughters I desire to marry thee, if for eight years thou wilt be my hired servant:10 and if thou fulfil ten, it shall be of thine own accord, for I wish not to deal hardly with thee
 Thou wilt find me, if God will, one of the upright
"  He said, "Be it so between me and thee: Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me
 And God is witness of what we say
"  And when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was journeying with his family, he perceived a fire on the mountain side
 He said to his family, "Wait ye, for I perceive a fire
 Haply I may bring you tidings from it, or a brand from the fire to warm you
"  And when he came up to it, a Voice cried to him11 out of the bush from the right side of the valley in the sacred hollow, "O Moses, I truly am God, the Lord of the Worlds:  Throw down now thy rod
" And when he saw it move as though it were a serpent, he retreated and fled and returned not
 "O Moses," cried the Voice, "draw near and fear not, for thou art in safety
  Put thy hand into thy bosom; it shall come forth white, but unharmed: and draw back thy hand12 to thee without fear
 These shall be two signs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his nobles; for they are a perverse people
"  He said, "O my Lord! truly I have slain one of them, therefore fear I lest they slay me
  My brother Aaron is clearer of speech than I
 Send him, therefore, with me as a help, and to make good my cause, for I fear lest they treat me as an impostor
"  He said, "We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother, and we will give power unto you both, and they shall not equal you in our signs
 Ye twain and they who shall follow you, shall gain the day
"  And when Moses came to him with our demonstrative signs they said, "This is nought but magical device
 We never heard the like among our sires of old
"  And Moses said, "My Lord best knoweth on whom He hath bestowed His guidance, and whose shall be the recompense of the abode of Paradise
 Verily, the wicked shall not prosper
"  And Pharaoh said, "O ye nobles, ye have no other God that I know of but myself
 Burn me then, Haman, bricks of clay,13 and build me a tower that I may mount up to the God of Moses, for in sooth, I deem him a liar
"  And he and his hosts behaved themselves proudly and unjustly on the earth, and thought that they should never be brought back to us
  But we seized on him and his hosts and cast them into the sea: Behold, then, the end of the wrongful doers:  And we made them imâms who invite to the fire of hell, and on the day of Resurrection they shall not be helped
  We followed them with a curse in this world, and covered shall they be with shame on the day of Resurrection
  And after we had destroyed the former generations, we gave the book of the Law to Moses for man's enlightening, and a guidance and a mercy, that haply they might reflect
  And thou wast not on the western slope of Sinai when we laid his charge on Moses, nor wast thou one of the witnesses;  But we raised up generations after Moses, men whose days were lengthened;14 neither didst thou dwell among the inhabitants of Madian to rehearse to them our signs, but we sent Apostles to them
15  Nor wast thou on the slope of Sinai when we called to Moses, but it is of the mercy of thy Lord that thou warnest a people, to whom no warner had come before thee, to the intent that they should reflect:  And that they should not say when a calamity shall befal them for their previous handy work, "O our Lord! why hast thou not sent an Apostle to us? Then we should have followed thy signs and have been of the believers
"  Yet when the truth came to them from our very presence, they said, "Unless the like powers be given to him that were given to Moses
 
 
 
"16 But did they not disbelieve in what of old was given to Moses? They said, "Two works of sorcery17 have helped each other;" and they said, "We disbelieve them both
"  SAY: Bring then a Book from before God which shall be a better guide than these, that I may follow it; if ye speak the truth
  And if they answer thee not, then know that verily they are following their own caprices: and who goeth more widely astray than he who followeth his own caprice without guidance from God? for God guideth not the wicked
  And now have we caused our word to come unto them, that they may be warned:  They18 to whom we gave the Scriptures before IT, do in IT believe
  And when it is recited to them they say, "We believe in it, for it is the truth from our Lord
 We were Muslims before it came
"  Twice shall their reward be given them, for that they suffered with patience, and repelled evil with good, and gave alms out of that with which we provided them
  And when they hear light discourse they withdraw from it, and say, "Our works for us and your works for you! Peace be on you! We are not in quest of fools!"  Thou truly canst not guide whom thou desirest; but God guideth whom He will; and He best knoweth those who yield to guidance
  But they say, "If we follow the way in which thou art guided,19 we shall be driven from our country
" But have we not established for them a sacred secure precinct, to which fruits of every kind, our gift for their support, are gathered together? But most of them have no knowledge
  And how many cities have we destroyed that flourished in wanton ease! And these their dwellings have not been inhabited since their time save by a few, and it is we who became their heirs
  But thy Lord did not destroy the cities till He had sent an apostle to their mother-city to rehearse our signs to its people: nor did we destroy the cities unless its people were unjust
  And all that hath been bestowed on you is merely for enjoyment and pomp of this life present: but that which is with God is better and more lasting
 Will ye not be wise?  Shall he then to whom we have promised a goodly promise and who obtaineth it, be as he on whom we have bestowed the enjoyments of this life present, and who on the day of Resurrection shall be brought up for punishment?  On that day will God cry to them and say, "Where are my companions, as ye supposed them?"  They on whom doom shall be justly pronounced will say, "O our Lord! these are they whom we led astray: we led them astray even as we had been led astray ourselves: Thou hast no cause of blame against us: It was not we whom they worshipped
20  And it shall be said, "Call now on those whom ye made God's companions:" and they shall call on them, but they will not answer them
 And they shall see the punishment, and wish that they had been guided aright
  And on that day shall God call to them and say, "How answered ye the apostles?"  But on that day they shall be too blinded with confusion to give an account,21 nor shall they ask it of one another
  Yet as to him who shall turn to God and believe and do the thing that is right, it may come to pass that he shall be among the happy
  And thy Lord createth what he will and hath a free choice
 But they, the false gods, have no power to choose
 Glory be to God! and high let him be exalted above those whom they associate with him
  And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal and what they bring to light
  And He is God! There is no god but He! His, all praise in this life and in the next, and His the power supreme,22 and to Him shall ye be brought back!  SAY: What think ye? If God should enshroud you with a long night until the day of resurrection, what god beside God would bring you light? Will ye not then hearken?  SAY: What think ye? If God should make it one long day for you until the day of resurrection, what god but God could bring you the night in which to take your rest? Will ye not then see?  Of His mercy he hath made for you the night that ye may take your rest in it; and the day that ye may seek what ye need out of his bounteous supplies, and that ye may give thanks
  One day God will call to them and say, "Where are my companions as ye supposed them?  And we will bring up a witness out of every nation and say, "Bring your proofs
" And they shall know that the truth is with God alone, and the gods of their own devising shall desert them
  Now Korah23 was of the people of Moses: but he behaved haughtily toward them; for we had given him such treasure that its keys would have burdened a company of men of strength
 When his people said to him, "Exult not, for God loveth not those who exult;  But seek, by means of what God hath given thee, to attain the future Mansion; and neglect not thy part in this world, but be bounteous to others as God hath been bounteous to thee, and seek not to commit excesses on the earth; for God loveth not those who commit excesses:"  He said, "It hath been given me only on account of the knowledge that is in me
" Did he not know that God had destroyed before him generations that were mightier than he in strength and had amassed more abundant wealth? But the wicked shall not be asked of their crimes
  And Korah went forth to his people in his pomp
 Those who were greedy for this present life said, "Oh that we had the like of that which hath been bestowed on Korah! Truly he is possessed of great good fortune
"  But they to whom knowledge had been given said, "Woe to you! the reward of God is better for him who believeth and worketh righteousness, and none shall win it but those who have patiently endured
"  And we clave the earth for him and for his palace, and he had no forces, in the place of God,24 to help him, nor was he among those who are succoured
  And in the morning those who the day before had coveted his lot said, "Aha! God enlargeth supplies to whom he pleaseth of his servants, or is sparing
 Had not God been gracious to us, He had caused it to cleave for us
 Aha! the ungrateful can never prosper
"  As to this future mansion, we will bestow it on those who seek not to exalt them in the earth or to do wrong: And there is a happy issue for the God- fearing
  Whoso doeth good shall have reward beyond its merits, and whoso doeth evil, they who do evil shall be rewarded only as they shall have wrought
  He who hath sanctioned the Koran to thee will certainly bring thee to thy home
25 SAY: My Lord best knoweth who hath guidance, and who is in undoubted error
  Thou didst never expect that the Book would be given thee
 Of thy Lord's mercy only hath it been sent down
 Be not thou helpful then to the unbelievers:  Neither let them turn thee aside from the signs of God after they have been sent down to thee, but bid men to thy Lord; and be not among those who add gods to God:  And call not on any other god with God
 There is no god but He! Everything shall perish except Himself! Judgment is His, and to Him shall ye return!   _______________________  1 See Sura lxviii

-THE TROOPS [LXXX
]  MECCA
-75 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  THE Book1 sent down from God, the Mighty, the Wise!  We have sent down the Book to thee with the truth: serve thou God then, and be sincere in thy worship:  Is not a sincere worship due to God?  But they who take others beside him as lords saying, "We serve them only that they may bring us near to God"-God will judge between them and the faithful, concerning that wherein they are at variance
  Verily God will not guide him who is a liar, an infidel
  Had God desired to have had a son, he had surely chosen what he pleased out of his own creation
 But praise be to Him! He is God, the One, the Almighty
  For truth2 hath he created the Heavens and the Earth: It is of Him that the night returneth upon the day and that the day returneth upon the night: and He controlleth the sun and the moon so that each speedeth to an appointed goal
 Is He not the Mighty, the Gracious?  He created you all of one man, from whom He afterwards formed his wife; and of cattle He hath sent down to you four pairs
3 In the wombs of your mothers did He create you by creation upon creation in triple darkness
 It is He who is God your Lord: the kingdom is His: There is no God but He
 How then are ye so turned aside from Him?  Suppose ye render him no thanks! yet forsooth is God rich without you: but He is not pleased with thanklessness in His servants: yet if ye be thankful He will be pleased with you
 The soul burdened with its own works shall not be burdened with the burden of another: hereafter shall ye return to your Lord, and he will tell you of all your works,  For he knoweth the very secrets of your breasts
  When some trouble toucheth a man, he turneth to his Lord and calleth on him: yet no sooner hath He enriched him with his favour than he forgetteth Him on whom he before had called, and setteth up peers with God, that he may beguile others from His way
 SAY: Enjoy thou thyself yet a little in thine ingratitude! but thou shalt surely be one of the inmates of the fire
  Shall he who observeth the hours of the night, prostrate or standing in devotion, heedful of the life to come, and hoping for the mercy of his Lord 
 
 
? SAY: Shall they who have knowledge and they who have it not, be treated alike? In sooth, men of understanding only will take the warning
  SAY: O my believing servants, fear your Lord
 For those who do good in this world there is good: and broad is God's earth4-verily those who endure with patience shall be repaid: their reward shall not be by measure
  SAY: I am bidden to serve God with a sincere worship: and I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender themselves to him (Muslims)
  SAY: Verily I fear if I rebel against my Lord the punishment of a great day
  SAY: God will I serve, presenting him with a sincere worship:  And serve ye what ye choose beside Him
 SAY: The losers truly will they be who shall lose their own souls and their families on the day of resurrection: Is not this the clear ruin?  Canopies of fire shall be over them, and floors of fire beneath them
 With this doth God alarm his servants: Fear ye me, then, O my servants!  But good tidings are there for those who shun the worship of Thagout and are turned to God
 Cheer then with good tidings those my servants who hearken to my word and follow its excellence
 These are they whom God guideth, and these are men of insight
  Him then on whom the sentence of punishment hath justly lighted-him who is doomed to the fire canst thou rescue?  But for those who fear their Lord are storied pavilions beneath which shall the rivers flow: it is the promise of God, and God will not fail in his promise
  Seest thou not that God sendeth down water from heaven, and guideth it along so as to form springs in the earth-then bringeth forth by it corn of varied sorts-then causeth he it to wither, and thou seest it become yellow-then crumbleth it away? Lo! herein is teaching for men of insight
  Shall he then whose breast God hath opened to Islam, and who hath light from his Lord 
 
 
? But woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God! They plainly err
  The best of recitals hath God sent down a book in unison with itself, and teaching by iteration
5 The very skins of those who fear their Lord do creep at it! Then do their skins and their hearts soften at the remembrance of their Lord! This is God's guidance: by it will He guide whom He pleaseth; and, whom God shall mislead, no guide shall there be for him
  Shall he who shall have nought but his own face to shelter him with from the torment of the punishment on the day of the resurrection 
 
 
? Aye, to the evil doers it shall be said, "Taste what ye have earned
"  They who were before them said it was a lie; but a punishment came upon them whence they looked not for it:  And God made them taste humiliation in this present life: but greater surely will be the punishment of the life to come
 Did they but know it!  Now have we set before man in this Koran every kind of parable for their warning:  An Arabic Koran, free from tortuous wording, to the intent that they may fear God
  God setteth forth the comparison of a man with associates6 at variance among themselves, and of a man devoted wholly to a man
 Are these to be held alike? No, praise be to God! But the greater part of them understand not
  Thou truly shall die, O Muhammad, and they too shall die:  Then, at the day of resurrection, ye shall wrangle with one another in the presence of your Lord
  And who acteth more unjustly than he who lieth of God, and treateth the truth when it cometh to him as a lie? Is there not a dwelling-place in Hell for the infidels?  But he who bringeth the truth, and he who believeth it to be the truth: these are the God-fearing
  Whatever they shall desire, awaiteth them with their Lord! This is the reward of the righteous;  That God may do away the guilt of their worst actions, and for their best actions render them their reward
  Is not God all-sufficient for his servant? Yet would they scare thee by their idols
 But no guide shall there be for him whom God misleadeth:  And he whom God guideth shall have none to mislead him
 Is not God, all- mighty, able to revenge?  And if thou ask them who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, they will surely answer, God
 SAY: Think ye, then, that they7 on whom ye call beside God, if God choose to afflict me, could remove his affliction? or if he choose to show me mercy, could they withhold His mercy? SAY: God sufficeth me: in Him let the trusting trust
  SAY: O my people, act your part as best ye can, I too will act mine; and in the end ye shall know  On whom shall light a punishment that shall shame him, and on whom a lasting punishment shall fall
  Assuredly we have sent down the Book to thee for man and for the ends of truth
 Whoso shall be guided by it-it will be for his own advantage, and whoso shall err, shall only err to his own loss
 But not to thy keeping are they entrusted
  God taketh souls unto Himself at death; and during their sleep those who do not die:8 and he retaineth those on which he hath passed a decree of death, but sendeth the others back till a time that is fixed
 Herein are signs for the reflecting
  Have they taken aught beside God as intercessors? SAY: What! though they have no power over anything, neither do they understand?  SAY: Intercession is wholly with God:9 His the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! To him shall ye be brought back hereafter!  But when the One God is named, the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come, shrivel up: but when the deities who are adored beside Him are named, lo! they are filled with joy
  SAY: O God, creator of the Heaven and of the Earth, who knowest the hidden and the manifest, thou shalt judge between thy servants as to the subject of their disputes
  If the wicked possessed all that is in the earth and as much again therewith, verily they would ransom themselves with it from the pain of the punishment on the day of the resurrection; and there shall appear to them, from God, things they had never reckoned on:  And their own ill deeds shall be clearly perceived by them, and that fire at which they mocked shall encircle them on every side
  When trouble befalleth a man he crieth to Us; afterwards, when we have vouchsafed favour to him, he saith, "God knew that I deserved it
"10 Nay, it is a trial
 But the greater part of them knew it not
  The same said those who flourished before them; but their deeds profited them not
  And their own ill deeds recoiled upon them
 And whoso among these (Meccans) shall do wrong, on them likewise their own misdeeds shall light, neither shall they invalidate God
  Know they not that God giveth supplies with open hand, and that He is sparing to whom He will? Of a truth herein are signs to those who believe
  SAY: O my servants who have transgressed to your own hurt,11 despair not of God's mercy, for all sins doth God forgive
 Gracious, Merciful is He!  And return ye to your Lord, and to Him resign yourselves, ere the punishment come on you, for then ye shall not be helped:  And follow that most excellent thing which hath been sent down to you from your Lord, ere the punishment come on you suddenly, and when ye look not for it:  So that a soul say, "Oh misery! for my failures in duty towards God! and verily I was of those who scoffed:"  Or say, "Had God guided me, I had surely been of those who feared Him:"  Or say, when it seeth the punishment, "Could I but return, then I would be of the righteous
"  Nay! my signs had already come to thee, and thou didst treat them as untruths, and wast arrogant, and becamest of those who believed not
  And on the resurrection day, thou shalt see those who have lied of God, with their faces black
 Is there not an abode in Hell for the arrogant?  But God shall rescue those who fear him into their safe retreat: no ill shall touch them, neither shall they be put to grief
  God is the creator of all things, and of all things is He the guardian! His the keys of the Heavens and of the Earth! and-who believe not in the signs of God-these! they shall perish!  SAY: What! do ye then bid me worship other than God, O ye ignorant ones?  But now hath it been revealed to thee and to those who flourished before thee,-"Verily, if thou join partners with God, vain shall be all thy work, and thyself shalt be of those who perish
  Nay, rather worship God! and be of those who render thanks
"  But they have not deemed of God as is His due;12 for on the resurrection day the whole Earth shall be but his handful, and in his right hand shall the Heavens be folded together
 Praise be to Him! and high be He uplifted above the partners they join with Him!  And there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and all who are in the Heavens and all who are in the Earth shall expire, save those whom God shall vouchsafe to live
 Then shall there be another blast on it, and lo! arising they shall gaze around them:  And the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book shall be set, and the prophets shall be brought up, and the witnesses; and judgment shall be given between them with equity; and none shall be wronged:  And every soul shall receive as it shall have wrought, for well knoweth He men's actions
  And by TROOPS shall the unbelievers be driven towards Hell, until when they reach it, its gates shall be opened, and its keepers shall say to them, "Came not apostles from among yourselves to you, reciting to you the signs of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting with Him on this your day?"13 They shall say, "Yes
" But just is the sentence of punishment on the unbelievers
  It shall be said to them, "Enter ye the gates of Hell, therein to dwell for ever;" and wretched the abode of the arrogant!  But those who feared their Lord shall be driven on by troops to Paradise, until when they reach it, its gates shall be opened, and its keepers shall say to them, "All hail! virtuous have ye been: enter then in, to abide herein for ever
"  And they shall say, "Praise be to God, who hath made good to us His promise, and hath given to us the earth as our heritage, that we may dwell in Paradise wherever we please!" And goodly is the reward of those who travailed virtuously
  And thou shalt see the Angels circling around the Throne with praises of their Lord: and judgment shall be pronounced between them with equity: and it shall be said, "Glory be to God the Lord of the Worlds

-THE SPIDER [LXXXI
]  MECCA-69 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ELIF
 LAM
 MIM
1 Think men that when they say, "We believe," they shall be let alone and not be put to proof?  We put to proof those who lived before them; for God will surely take knowledge of those who are sincere, and will surely take knowledge of the liars
  Think they who work evil that they shall escape Us? Ill do they judge
  To him who hopeth to meet God, the set time of God will surely come
 The Hearer, the Knower, He!  Whoso maketh efforts for the faith, maketh them for his own good only
 Verily God is rich enough to dispense with all creatures
  And as to those who shall have believed and done the things that are right, their evil deeds will we surely blot out from them, and according to their best actions will we surely reward them
  Moreover we have enjoined on man to shew kindness to parents: but if they strive with thee that thou join that with Me of which thou hast no knowledge,2 obey them not
 To me do ye return, and then will I tell you of your doings:  And those who shall have believed and done the things that are right, we will surely give them an entering in among the just
  But some men say, "We believe in God," yet when they meet with sufferings in the cause of God, they regard trouble from man as chastisement from God
 Yet if a success come from thy Lord they are sure to say, "We were on your side!" Doth not God well know what is in the breasts of his creatures?  Yes, and God well knoweth those who believe, and He well knoweth the Hypocrites
  The unbelievers say to the faithful, "Follow ye our way, and we will surely bear your sins
" But not aught of their sins will they bear-verily they are liars!  But their own burdens, and burdens beside their own burdens shall they surely bear: and inquisition shall be made of them on the day of Resurrection as to their false devices
  Of old sent we Noah to his people: a thousand years save fifty did he tarry among them; and the flood overtook them in their wrongful doings:  But we rescued him and those who were in the vessel; and we made it a sign to all men:  And Abraham; when he said to his people, "Worship God and fear Him
 This will be best for you, if ye have knowledge;"  Ye only worship idols beside God, and are the authors of a lie
 Those whom ye worship beside God can give you no supplies: seek, then, your supplies from God; and serve Him and give Him thanks
 To Him shall ye return
  Suppose that ye treat me as a liar! nations before you have treated God's messenger as a liar; but open preaching is his only duty
  See they not how God bringeth forth creation? and then causeth it to return again? This truly is easy for God
  SAY,3 Go through the earth, and see how he hath brought forth created beings
 Hereafter, with a second birth will God cause them to be born again; for God is Almighty
  Whom He pleaseth will He chastise, and on whom He pleaseth will He have mercy, and to Him shall ye be taken back
  And ye shall not invalidate his power either in the Earth or in the Heaven:4 and, save God, ye shall have neither patron nor helper
  As for those who believe not in the signs of God, or that they shall ever meet him, these of my mercy shall despair, and these doth a grievous chastisement await
"  And the only answer of his people was to say, "Slay him or burn him
" But from the fire did God save him! Verily, herein are signs to those who believe
  And Abraham said, "Of a truth ye have taken idols along with God as your bond of union5 in this life present;  But on the day of resurrection some of you shall deny the others, and some of you shall curse the others; and your abode shall be the fire, and ye shall have none to help
"  But Lot believed on him,6 and said, "I betake me to my Lord, for He truly is the Mighty, the Wise
"  And we bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob,7 and placed the gift of prophecy and the Scripture among his posterity; And we gave him his reward in this world, and in the next he shall be among the just
  We sent also Lot: when he said to his people, "Proceed ye to a filthiness in which no people in the world hath ever gone before you?  Proceed ye even to men? attack ye them on the highway? and proceed ye to the crime in your assemblies?" But the only answer of his people was to say, "Bring God's chastisement upon us, if thou art a man of truth
"  He cried: My Lord! help me against this polluted people
  And when our messengers came to Abraham with the tidings of a son, they said, "Of a truth we will destroy the in-dwellers in this city, for its in-dwellers are evil doers
"  He said, "Lot is therein
" They said, "We know full well who therein is
 Him and his family will we save, except his wife; she will be of those who linger
  And when our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled for them, and his arm was too weak8 to protect them; and they said, "Fear not, and distress not thyself, for thee and thy family will we save, except thy wife; she will be of those who linger
9  We will surely bring down upon the dwellers in this city vengeance from Heaven for the excesses they have committed
"  And in what we have left of it is a clear sign to men of understanding
  And to Madian we sent their brother Shoaib
 And he said, "Oh! my people! worship God, and expect the latter day, and enact not in the land deeds of harmful excess
"  But they treated him as an impostor: so an earthquake assailed them; and at morn they were found prostrate and dead in their dwellings
  And we destroyed Ad and Themoud
 Already is this made plain to you in the ruins of their dwellings
 For Satan had made their own works fair seeming to them, and drew them from the right path, keen-sighted though they were
  And Corah and Pharaoh and Haman
 With proofs of his mission did Moses come to them, and they behaved proudly on the earth; but us they could not outstrip;10  For, every one of them did we seize in his sin
 Against some of them did wesend a stone-charged wind: Some of them did the terrible cry of Gabriel surprise: for some of them we cleaved the earth; and some of them we drowned
 And it was not God who would deal wrongly by them, but they wronged themselves
  The likeness for those who take to themselves guardians instead of God is the likeness of the SPIDER who buildeth her a house: But verily, frailest of all houses surely is the house of the spider
 Did they but know this!  God truly knoweth all that they call on beside Him; and He is the Mighty, the Wise
  These similitudes do we set forth to men: and none understand them except the wise
  God hath created the Heavens and the Earth for a serious end
11 Verily in this is a sign to those who believe
  Recite the portions of the Book which have been revealed to thee and discharge the duty of prayer: for prayer restraineth from the filthy and the blame-worthy
 And the gravest duty is the remembrance of God; and God knoweth what ye do
  Dispute not, unless in kindly sort, with the people of the Book;12 save with such of them as have dealt wrongfully with you: And say ye, "We believe in what hath been sent down to us and hath been sent down to you
 Our God and your God is one, and to him are we self-surrendered" (Muslims)
  Thus have we sent down the Book of the Koran to thee: and they to whom we have given the Book of the law believe in it: and of these Arabians there are those who believe in it: and none, save the Infidels, reject our signs
  Thou didst not recite any book (of revelation) before it: with that right hand of thine thou didst not transcribe one: else might they who treat it as a vain thing have justly doubted:  But it is a clear sign in the hearts of those whom "the knowledge" hath reached
 None except the wicked reject our signs
  And they say, "Unless a sign be sent down to him from his Lord
 
 
 
" SAY: Signs are in the power of God alone
 I am only a plain spoken warner
  Is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the Book to be recited to them? In this verily is a mercy and a warning to those who believe
  SAY: God is witness enough between me and you
  He knoweth all that is in the Heavens and the Earth, and they who believe in vain things13 and disbelieve in God-these shall be the lost ones
  They will challenge thee to hasten the punishment: but had there not been a season fixed for it, that punishment had already come upon them
 But it shall overtake them suddenly when they look not for it
  They will challenge thee to hasten the punishment: but verily Hell shall be round about the infidels
  One day the punishment shall wrap them round, both from above them and from beneath their feet; and God will say, "Taste ye your own doings
"  O my servants who have believed! Vast truly is my Earth:14 me, therefore! yea worship me
  Every soul shall taste of death
 Then to us shall ye return
  But those who shall have believed and wrought righteousness will we lodge in gardens with palaces, beneath which the rivers flow
 For ever shall they abide therein
 How goodly the reward of those who labour,  Who patiently endure, and put their trust in their Lord!  How many animals are there which provide not15 their own food! God feedeth them and you
 He Heareth, Knoweth all things
  If thou ask them who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, and hath imposed laws on the sun and on the moon, they will certainly say, "God
" How then can they devise lies?  God lavisheth supplies on such of his servants as He pleaseth or giveth to them by measure
 God knoweth all things
  If thou ask them who sendeth rain from heaven, and by it quickeneth the earth, after it hath been dead, they will certainly answer, "God
" SAY: Praise be to God! Yet most of them do not understand
  This present life is no other than a pastime and a disport: but truly the future mansion is life indeed! Would that they knew this!  Lo! when they embark on shipboard, they call upon God, vowing him sincere worship, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold they join partners with Him
  In our revelation they believe not, yet take their fill of good things
 But in the end they shall know their folly
  Do they not see that we have established a safe precinct16 while all around them men are being spoiled? Will they then believe in vain idols, and not own the goodness of God?  But who acteth more wrongly than he who deviseth a lie against God, or calls the truth when it hath come to him, a lie? Is there not an abode for the infidels in Hell?  And whoso maketh efforts for us, in our ways will we guide them: for God is assuredly with those who do righteous deeds

2 These are the verses (signs) of the wise Book,  A guidance and a mercy to the righteous,  Who observe prayer, and pay the impost,3 and believe firmly in the life to come:-  These rest on guidance from their Lord, and with these it shall be well
  But a man there is4 who buyeth an idle tale, that in his lack of knowledge he may mislead others from the way of God, and turn it to scorn
 For such is prepared a shameful punishment!  And when our signs are rehearsed to him, he turneth away disdainfully, as though he heard them not,-as though his ears were heavy with deafness
 Announce to him therefore tidings of an afflictive punishment!  But they who shall have believed and wrought good works, shall enjoy the gardens of delight:  For ever shall they dwell therein: it is God's true promise! and He is the Mighty, the Wise
  Without pillars that can be seen hath He created the heavens, and on the earth hath thrown mountains lest it should move with you;5 and He hath scattered over it animals of every sort: and from the Heaven we send down rain and cause every kind of noble plant to grow up therein
  This is the creation of God: Shew me now what others than He have created
 Ah! the ungodly are in a manifest delusion
  Of old we bestowed wisdom upon LOKMAN, and taught him thus-"Be thankful to God: for whoever is thankful, is thankful to his own behoof; and if any shall be thankless 
 
 
  God truly is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise!"  And bear in mind when Lokman said to his son by way of warning, "O my son! join not other gods with God, for the joining gods with God is the great impiety
"  (We have commanded6 man concerning his parents
 His mother carrieth him with weakness upon weakness; nor until after two years is he weaned
7 Be grateful to me, and to thy parents
 Unto me shall all come
  But if they importune thee to join that with Me of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not: comport thyself towards them in this world as is meet and right; but follow the way of him who turneth unto me
 Unto me shall ye return at last, and then will I tell you of your doings;)  "O my son! verily God will bring everything to light, though it were but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and hidden in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth; for, God is subtile, informed of all
  O my son! observe prayer, and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and be patient under whatever shall betide thee: for this is a bounden duty
  And distort not thy face at men; nor walk thou loftily on the earth; for God loveth no arrogant vain-glorious one
  But let thy pace be middling; and lower thy voice: for the least pleasing of voices is surely the voice of asses
"  See ye not how that God hath put under you all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and hath been bounteous to you of his favours, both for soul and body
8 But some are there who dispute of God without knowledge, and have no guidance and no illuminating Book:  And when it is said to them, Follow ye what God hath sent down, they say, "Nay; that religion in which we found our fathers will we follow
" What! though Satan bid them to the torment of the flame?  But whoso setteth his face toward God with self-surrender, and is a doer of that which is good, hath laid hold on a sure handle; for unto God is the issue of all things
  But let not the unbelief of the unbelieving grieve thee: unto us shall they return: then will we tell them of their doings; for God knoweth the very secrets of the breast
  Yet a little while will we provide for them: afterwards will we force them to a stern punishment
  If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly reply, "God
" SAY: God be praised! But most of them have no knowledge
  God's, whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth! for God, He is the Rich,9 the Praiseworthy
  If all the trees that are upon the earth were to become pens, and if God should after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink, His words would not be exhausted: for God is Mighty, Wise
10  Your creation and your quickening hereafter, are but as those of a single individual
 Verily, God Heareth, Seeth!  Seest thou not that God causeth the night to come in upon the day, and the day to come in upon the night? and that he hath subjected the sun and the moon to laws by which each speedeth along to an appointed goal? and that God therefore is acquainted with that which ye do?  This, for that God is the truth; and that whatever ye call upon beside Him is a vain thing; and that God-He is the High, the Great
  Seest thou not how the ships speed on in the sea, through the favour of God, that he may shew you of his signs? for herein are signs to all patient, grateful ones
  When the waves cover them like dark shadows they call upon God as with sincere religion; but when He safely landeth them, some of them there are who halt between two opinions
11 Yet none reject our signs but all deceitful, ungrateful ones
  O men! fear ye your Lord, and dread the day whereon father shall not atone for son, neither shall a son in the least atone for his father
  Aye! the promise of God is a truth
 Let not this present life then deceive you; neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God
  Aye! God!-with Him is the knowledge of the Hour: and He sendeth down the rain-and He knoweth what is in the wombs-but no soul knoweth what it shall have gotten on the morrow: neither knoweth any soul in what land it shall die
 But God is knowing, informed of all

1 Thus unto thee as unto those who preceded thee doth God, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal!  All that is in the Heavens and all that is in the Earth is His: and He is the High, the Great!  Ready are the Heavens to cleave asunder from above for very awe: and the angels celebrate the praise of their Lord, and ask forgiveness for the dwellers on earth: Is not God the Indulgent, the Merciful?  But whose take aught beside Him as lords-God watcheth them! but thou hast them not in thy charge
  It is thus moreover that we have revealed to thee an Arabic Koran, that thou mayest warn the mother city2 and all around it, and that thou mayest warn them of that day of the Gathering, of which there is no doubt-when part shall be in Paradise and part in the flame
  Had God so pleased, He had made them one people and of one creed: but He bringeth whom He will within His mercy; and as for the doers of evil, no patron, no helper shall there be for them
  Will they take other patrons than Him? But God is man's only Lord: He quickeneth the dead; and He is mighty over all things
  And whatever the subject of your disputes, with God doth its decision rest
 This is God, my Lord: in Him do I put my trust, and to Him do I turn in penitence;  Creator of the Heavens and of the Earth! he hath given you wives from among your own selves, and cattle male and female-by this means to multiply you: Nought is there like Him! the Hearer, the Beholder He!  His, the keys of the Heavens and of the Earth! He giveth with open hand, or sparingly, to whom He will: He knoweth all things
  To you hath He prescribed the faith which He commanded unto Noah, and which we have revealed to thee, and which we commanded unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying, "Observe this faith, and be not divided into sects therein
" Intolerable to those who worship idols jointly with God  Is that faith to which thou dost call them
 Whom He pleaseth will God choose for it, and whosoever shall turn to Him in penitence will He guide to it
  Nor were they divided into sects through mutual jealousy, till after that "the knowledge" had come to them: and had not a decree from thy Lord gone forth respiting them to a fixed time, verily, there had at once been a decision between them
3 And they who have inherited "the Book" after them, are in perplexity of doubt concerning it
  For this cause summon thou them to the faith, and go straight on as thou hast been bidden, and follow not their desires: and SAY: In whatsoever Books God hath sent down do I believe: I am commanded to decide justly between you: God is your Lord and our Lord: we have our works and you have your works: between us and you let there be no strife: God will make us all one: and to Him shall we return
  And as to those who dispute about God, after pledges of obedience given to Him,4 their disputings shall be condemned by their Lord, and wrath shall be on them, and theirs shall be a sore torment
  It is God who hath sent down the Book with truth, and the Balance:5 but who shall inform thee whether haply "the Hour" be nigh?  They who believe not in it, challenge its speedy coming:6 but they who believe are afraid because of it, and know it to be a truth
 Are not they who dispute of the Hour, in a vast error?  Benign is God towards his servants: for whom He will doth He provide: and He is the Strong, the Mighty
  Whoso will choose the harvest field of the life to come, to him will we give increase in this his harvest field: and whoso chooseth the harvest field of this life, thereof will we give him: but no portion shall there be for him in the life to come
7  Is it that they have gods who have sanctioned for them aught in the matter of religion which God hath not allowed? But had it not been for a decree of respite till the day of severance, judgment had ere now taken place among them; and assuredly the impious shall undergo a painful torment
  On that day thou shalt see the impious alarmed at their own works, and the consequence thereof shall fall upon them: but they who believe and do the things that are right, shall dwell in the meadows of paradise: whatever they shall desire awaiteth them with their Lord
 This, the greatest boon
  This is what God announceth to his servants who believe and do the things that are right
 SAY: For this ask I no wage of you, save the love of my kin
 And whoever shall have won the merit of a good deed, we will increase good to him therewith; for God is forgiving, grateful
  Will they say he hath forged a lie of God? If God pleased,  He could then seal up thy very heart
8 But God will bring untruth to nought, and will make good the truth by his word: for He knoweth the very secrets of the breast
  He it is who accepteth repentance from his servants, and forgiveth their sins and knoweth your actions:  And to those who believe and do the things that are right will he hearken, and augment his bounties to them:9 but the unbelievers doth a terrible punishment await
  Should God bestow abundance upon his servants, they might act wantonly on the earth: but He sendeth down what He will by measure; for he knoweth, beholdeth his servants
  He it is who after that men have despaired of it, sendeth down the rain, and spreadeth abroad his mercy: He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy
  Among his signs is the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth, and the creatures which he hath scattered over both: and, for their gathering together when he will, He is allpowerful!  Nor happeneth to you any mishap, but it is for your own handy-work: and yet he forgiveth many things
  Ye cannot weaken him on the earth: neither, beside God, patron or helper shall ye have
  Among his signs also are the sea-traversing ships like mountains: if such be his will, He lulleth the wind, and they lie motionless on the back of the waves:-truly herein are signs to all the constant, the grateful;-  Or if, for their ill deserts, He cause them to founder, still He forgiveth much:  But they who gainsay our signs shall know that there will be no escape for them
  All that you receive is but for enjoyment in this life present: but better and more enduring is a portion with God, for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord;  And who avoid the heinous things of crime, and filthiness, and when they are angered, forgive;  And who hearken to their Lord, and observe prayer, and whose affairs are guided by mutual COUNSEL, and who give alms of that with which we have enriched them;  And who, when a wrong is done them, redress themselves:  -Yet let the recompense of evil be only a like evil but he who forgiveth and is reconciled, shall be rewarded by God himself; for He loveth not those who act unjustly
  And there shall be no way open against those who, after being wronged, avenge themselves;  But there shall be a way open against those who unjustly wrong others, and act insolently on the earth in disregard of justice
 These! a grievous punishment doth await them
  And whoso beareth wrongs with patience and forgiveth;-this verily is a bounden duty;  But he whom God shall cause to err, shall thenceforth have no protector
 And thou shalt behold the perpetrators of injustice,  Exclaiming, when they see the torment, "Is there no way to return?"  And thou shalt see them when set before it, downcast for the shame: they shall look at it with stealthy glances: and the believers shall say, "Truly are the losers they who have lost themselves and their families on the day of Resurrection! Shall not the perpetrators of injustice be in lasting torment?"  And no other protectors shall there be to succour them than God; and no pathway for him whom God shall cause to err
  Hearken then to your Lord ere the day come, which none can put back when God doth ordain its coming
 No place of refuge for you on that day! no denying your own works!  But if they turn aside from thee, yet we have not sent thee to be their guardian
 'Tis thine but to preach
 When we cause man to taste our gifts of mercy, he rejoiceth in it; but if for their by-gone handy-work evil betide them, then lo! is man ungrateful
  God's, the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! He createth what He will! and he giveth daughters to whom He will, and sons to whom He will:  Or He giveth them children of both sexes, and He maketh whom He will to be childless; for He is Wise, Powerful!  It is not for man that God should speak with him but by vision, or from behind a veil:  Or, He sendeth a messenger to reveal, by his permission, what He will: for He is Exalted, Wise!  Thus have we sent the Spirit (Gabriel10) to thee with a revelation, by our command
 Thou knewest not, ere this, what "the Book" was, or what the faith
 But we have ordained it for a light: by it will we guide whom we please of our servants
 And thou shalt surely guide into the right way,  The way of God, whose is all that the Heaven and the Earth contain
 Shall not all things return to God?   _______________________  1 See Sura lxviii

1 These are the signs of the wise Book!  A matter of wonderment is it to the men of Mecca, that to a person among themselves We revealed, "Bear warnings to the people: and, to those who believe, bear the good tidings that they shall have with their Lord the precedence merited by their sincerity
" The unbelievers say, "Verily this is a manifest sorcerer
"  Verily your Lord is God who hath made the Heavens and the Earth in six days- then mounted his throne to rule all things: None can intercede with him till after his permission: This is God your Lord: therefore serve him: Will ye not reflect?  Unto Him shall ye return, all together: the promise of God is sure: He produceth a creature, then causeth it to return again-that he may reward those who believe and do the things that are right, with equity: but as for the infidels!-for them the draught that boileth and an afflictive torment- because they have not believed
  It is He who hath appointed the sun for brightness, and the moon for a light, and hath ordained her stations that ye may learn the number of years and the reckoning of time
 God hath not created all this but for the truth
2 He maketh his signs clear to those who understand
  Verily, in the alternations of night and of day, and in all that God hath created in the Heavens and in the Earth are signs to those who fear Him
  Verily, they who hope not to meet Us, and find their satisfaction in this world's life, and rest on it, and who of our signs are heedless;-  These! their abode the fire, in recompense of their deeds!  But they who believe and do the things that are right, shall their Lord direct aright because of their faith
 Rivers shall flow at their feet in gardens of delight:  Their cry therein, "Glory be to thee, O God!" and their salutation therein, "Peace!"  And the close of their cry, "Praise be to God, Lord, of all creatures!"  Should God hasten evil on men as they fain would hasten their good, then were their end decreed! So leave we those who hope not to meet Us, bewildered in their error
  When trouble toucheth a man, he crieth to us, on his side, or sitting, or standing; and when we withdraw his trouble from him, he passeth on as though he had not called on us against the trouble which touched him! Thus are the deeds of transgressors pre-arranged for them
  And of old destroyed we generations before you, when they had acted wickedly, and their Apostles had come to them with clear tokens of their mission, and they would not believe:-thus reward we the wicked
  Then we caused you to succeed them on the earth, that we might see how ye would act
  But when our clear signs are recited to them, they who look not forward to meet Us, say, "Bring a different Koran from this, or make some change in it
" SAY: It is not for me to change it as mine own soul prompteth
 I follow only what is revealed to me: verily, I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the punishment of a great day
  SAY: Had God so pleased, I had not recited it to you, neither had I taught it to you
 Already have I dwelt among you for years, ere it was revealed to me
 Understand ye not?  And who is more unjust than he who coineth a lie against God, or treateth his signs as lies? Surely the wicked shall not prosper!  And they worship beside God, what cannot hurt or help them; and say, "These are our advocates with God!" SAY: Will ye inform God of aught in the Heavens and in the Earth which he knoweth not? Praise be to Him! High be He exalted above the deities they join with Him!  Men were of one religion only:3 then they fell to variance: and had not a decree (of respite) previously gone forth from thy Lord, their differences had surely been decided between them!  They say: "Unless a sign be sent down to him from his Lord
 
 
 
" But SAY: The hidden is only with God: wait therefore: I truly will be with you among those who wait
  And when after a trouble which you befallen them,4 we caused this people to taste of mercy, lo! a plot on their part against our signs! SAY: Swifter to plot is God! Verily, our messengers note down your plottings
  He it is who enableth you to travel by land and sea, so that ye go on board of ships-which sail on with them, with favouring breeze in which they rejoice
 But if a tempestuous gale overtake them, and the billow come on them from every side, and they think that they are encompassed therewith, they call on God, professing sincere religion:-"Wouldst thou but rescue us from this, then will we indeed be of the thankful
"  But when we have rescued them, lo! they commit unrighteous excesses on the earth! O men! assuredly your self-injuring excess is only an enjoyment of this life present: soon ye return to us: and we will let you know what ye have done!  Verily, this present life is like the water which we send down from Heaven, and the produce of the earth, of which men and cattle eat, is mingled with it, till the earth hath received its golden raiment, and is decked out: and they who dwell on it deem that they have power over it! but, Our behest cometh to it by night or by day, and we make it as if it had been mown, as if it had not teemed only yesterday! Thus make we our signs clear to those who consider
  And God calleth to the abode of peace;5 and He guideth whom He will into the right way
  Goodness6 itself and an increase of it for those who do good! neither blackness nor shame shall cover their faces! These shall be the inmates of Paradise, therein shall they abide for ever
  And as for those who have wrought out evil, their recompense shall be evil of like degree, and shame shall cover them-no protector shall they have against God: as though their faces were darkened with deep murk of night! These shall be inmates of the fire: therein they shall abide for ever
  And on that day will we gather them all together: then will we say to those who added gods to God, "To your place, ye and those added gods of yours!" Then we will separate between them: and those their gods shall say, "Ye served us not:7  And God is a sufficient witness between us and you: we cared not aught for your worship
"  There shall every soul make proof of what itself shall have sent on before, and they shall be brought back to God, their true lord, and the deities of their own devising shall vanish from them
  SAY: Who supplieth you from the Heaven and the Earth? Who hath power over hearing and sight? And who bringeth forth the living from the dead, and bringeth forth the dead from the living? And who ruleth all things? They will surely say, "God:" then SAY: "What! will ye not therefore fear him?  This God then is your true Lord: and when the truth is gone, what remaineth but error? How then are ye so perverted?  Thus is the word of thy Lord made good on the wicked, that they shall not believe
  SAY: Is there any of the gods whom ye add to God who produceth a creature, then causeth it to return to him? SAY: God produceth a creature, then causeth it to return to Him: How therefore are ye turned aside?  SAY: Is there any of the gods ye add to God who guideth into the truth? SAY: God guideth into the truth
 Is He then who guideth into the truth the more worthy to be followed, or he who guideth not unless he be himself guided? What then hath befallen you that ye so judge?  And most of them follow only a conceit:-But a conceit attaineth to nought of truth! Verily God knoweth what they say
  Moreover this Koran could not have been devised by any but God: but it confirmeth what was revealed before it, and is a clearing up of the Scriptures-there is no doubt thereof-from the Lord of all creatures
  Do they say, "He hath devised it himself?" SAY: Then bring a Sura like it; and call on whom ye can beside God, if ye speak truth
  But that which they embrace not in their knowledge have they charged with falsehood, though the explanation of it had not yet been given them
 So those who were before them brought charges of imposture: But see what was the end of the unjust!  And some of them believe in it, and some of them believe not in it
 But thy Lord well knoweth the transgressors
  And if they charge thee with imposture, then SAY: My work for me, and your work for you! Ye are clear of that which I do, and I am clear of that which ye do
  And some of them lend a ready ear to thee: But wilt thou make the deaf to hear even though they understand not?  And some of them look at thee: But wilt thou guide the blind even though they see not?  Verily, God will not wrong men in aught, but men will wrong themselves
  Moreover, on that day, He will gather them all together: They shall seem as though they had waited but an hour of the day! They shall recognise one another! Now perish they who denied the meeting with God, and were not guided aright!  Whether we cause thee to see some of our menaces against them fulfilled, or whether we first take thee to Ourself,8 to us do they return
 Then shall God bear witness of what they do
  And every people hath had its apostle
9 And when their apostle came, a rightful decision took place between them, and they were not wronged
  Yet they say, "When will this menace be made good? Tell us if ye speak truly
"  SAY: I have no power over my own weal or woe, but as God pleaseth
 Every people hath its time: when their time is come, they shall neither retard nor advance it an hour
  SAY: How think ye? if God's punishment came on you by night or by day, what portion of it would the wicked desire to hasten on?  When it falleth on you, will ye believe it then? Yes! ye will believe it then
 Yet did ye challenge its speedy coming
  Then shall it be said to the transgressors, "Taste ye the punishment of eternity! Shall ye be rewarded but as ye have wrought?"  They will desire thee to inform them whether this be true? SAY: Yes! by my Lord it is the truth: and it is not ye who can weaken Him
  And every soul that hath sinned, if it possessed all that is on earth, would assuredly ransom itself therewith; and they will proclaim their repentance when they have seen the punishment: and there shall be a rightful decision between them, and they shall not be unjustly dealt with
  Is not whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth God's? Is not then the promise of God true? Yet most of them know it not
  He maketh alive and He causeth to die, and to Him shall ye return
  O men! now hath a warning come to you from your Lord, and a medicine for what is in your breasts, and a guidance and a mercy to believers
  SAY: Through the grace of God and his mercy! and in this therefore let them rejoice: better is this than all ye amass
  SAY: What think ye? of what God hath sent down to you for food, have ye made unlawful and lawful? SAY: Hath God permitted you? or invent ye on the part of God?  But what on the day of Resurrection will be the thought of those who invent a lie on the part of God? Truly God is full of bounties to man; but most of them give not thanks
  Thou shalt not be employed in affairs, nor shalt thou read a text out of the Koran, nor shall ye work any work, but we will be witnesses over you when ye are engaged therein: and not the weight of an atom on Earth or in Heaven escapeth thy Lord; nor is there aught that is less than this or greater, but it is in the perspicuous Book
  Are not the friends of God, those on whom no fear shall come, nor shall they be put to grief?  They who believe and fear God-  For them are good tidings in this life, and in the next! There is no change in the words of God! This, the great felicity!  And let not their discourse grieve thee: for all might is God's: the Hearer, the Knower, He!  Is not whoever is in the Heavens and the Earth subject to God? What then do they follow who, beside God, call upon deities they have joined with Him? They follow but a conceit, and they are but liars!  It is He who hath ordained for you the night wherein to rest, and the lightsome day
 Verily in this are signs for those who hearken
  They say, "God hath begotten children
" No! by his glory! He is the self- sufficient
 All that is in the Heavens and all that is in the Earth is His! Have ye warranty for that assertion? What! speak ye of God that which ye know not?  SAY: Verily, they who devise this lie concerning God shall fare ill
  A portion have they in this world! Then to us they return! Then make we them to taste the vehement torment, for that they were unbelievers
  Recite to them the history of Noah,10 when he said to his people,-If, O my people! my abode with you, and my reminding you of the signs of God, be grievous to you, yet in God is my trust: Muster, therefore, your designs and your false gods, and let not your design be carried on by you in the dark: then come to some decision about me, and delay not
  And if ye turn your backs on me, yet ask I no reward from you: my reward is with God alone, and I am commanded to be of the Muslims
  But they treated him as a liar: therefore we rescued him and those who were with him in the ark, and we made them to survive the others; and we drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood
 See, then, what was the end of these warned ones!  Then after him, we sent Apostles to their peoples, and they came to them with credentials; but they would not believe in what they had denied aforetime: Thus seal we up the hearts of the transgressors!  Then sent we, after them, Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nobles with our signs; but they acted proudly and were a wicked people:  And when the truth came to them from us, they said, "Verily, this is clear sorcery
"  Moses said: "What! say ye of the truth after it hath come to you, 'Is this sorcery?' But sorcerers shall not prosper
"  They said: "Art thou come to us to pervert us from the faith in which we found our fathers, and that you twain shall bear rule in this land? But we believe you not
"  And Pharaoh said: "Fetch me every skilled magician
" And when the magicians arrived, Moses said to them, "Cast down what ye have to cast
"  And when they had cast them down, Moses said, "Verily, God will render vain the sorceries which ye have brought to pass: God prospereth not the work of the evildoers
  And by his words will God verify the Truth, though the impious be averse to it
  And none believed on Moses but a race among his own people, through fear of Pharaoh and his nobles, lest he should afflict them: For of a truth mighty was Pharaoh in the land, and one who committed excesses
  And Moses said: "O my people! if ye believe in God, then put your trust in Him-if ye be Muslims
"  And they said: "In God put we our trust
 O our Lord! abandon us not to trial from that unjust people,  And deliver us by thy mercy from the unbelieving people
"  Then thus revealed we to Moses and to his brother: "Provide houses for your people in Egypt, and in your houses make a Kebla, and observe prayer and proclaim good tidings to the believers
"  And Moses said: "O our Lord! thou hast indeed given to Pharaoh and his nobles splendour and riches in this present life: O our Lord! that they may err from thy way! O our Lord! confound their riches, and harden their hearts that they may not believe till they see the dolorous torment
"  He said: "The prayer of you both is heard: pursue ye both therefore the straight path, and follow not the path of those who have no knowledge
"  And we led the children of Israel through the sea; and Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in eager and hostile sort until, when the drowning overtook him, he said, "I believe that there is no God but he on whom the children of Israel believe, and I am one of the Muslims
"  "Yes, now," said God: "but thou hast been rebellious hitherto, and wast one of the wicked doers
  But this day will we rescue thee with thy body that thou mayest be a sign to those who shall be after thee:11 but truly, most men are of our signs regardless!"  Moreover we prepared a settled abode for the children of Israel, and provided them with good things: nor did they fall into variance till the knowledge (the Law) came to them: Truly thy Lord will decide between them on the day of Resurrection concerning that in which they differed
  And if thou art in doubt as to what we have sent down to thee, inquire at those who have read the Scriptures before thee
12 Now hath the truth come unto thee from thy Lord: be not therefore of those who doubt
  Neither be of those who charge the signs of God with falsehood, lest thou be of those who perish
  Verily they against whom the decree of thy Lord is pronounced, shall not believe,  Even though every kind of sign come unto them, till they behold the dolorous torment!  Were it otherwise, any city, had it believed, might have found its safety in its faith
 But it was so, only with the people of JONAS
 When they believed, we delivered them from the penalty of shame in this world, and provided for them for a time
  But if thy Lord had pleased, verily all who are in the earth would have believed together
 What! wilt thou compel men to become believers?  No soul can believe but by the permission of God: and he shall lay his wrath on those who will not understand
  SAY: Consider ye whatever is in the Heavens and on the Earth: but neither signs, nor warners, avail those who will not believe!  What then can they expect but the like of such days of wrath as befel those who flourish before them? SAY: WAIT; I too will wait with you:  Then will we deliver our apostles and those who believe
 Thus is it binding on us to deliver the faithful
  SAY: O men! if ye are in doubt as to my religion, verily I worship not what ye worship beside God; but I worship God who will cause you to die: and I am commanded to be a believer
  And set thy face toward true religion, sound in faith, and be not of those who join other gods with God:  Neither invoke beside God that which can neither help nor hurt thee: for if thou do, thou wilt certainly then be one of those who act unjustly
  And if God lay the touch of trouble on thee, none can deliver thee from it but He: and if He will thee any good, none can keep back his boons
 He will confer them on such of his servants as he chooseth: and He is the Gracious, the Merciful!  SAY: O men! now hath the truth come unto you from your Lord
 He therefore who will be guided, will be guided only for his own behoof: but he who shall err will err only against it; and I am not your guardian!  And follow what is revealed to thee: and persevere steadfastly till God shall judge, for He is the best of Judges

-SABA1 [LXXXV
]  MECCA
-54 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  PRAISE be to God! to whom belongeth all that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth; and to Him be praise in the next world: for he is the All- wise, the All-informed!  He knoweth what entereth into the earth, and what proceedeth from it; and what cometh down from heaven, and what goeth up into it: and He is the Merciful, the Forgiving!  "Never," say the unbelievers, "will the Hour come upon us!" SAY: Yea, by my Lord who knoweth the unseen, it will surely come upon you! not the weight of a mote either in the Heavens or in the Earth escapeth him; nor is there aught less than this or aught greater, which is not in the clear Book;-  To the intent that God may reward those who have believed and done the things that are right: Pardon and a noble provision shall they receive:  But as for those who aim to invalidate our signs,-a chastisement of painful torment awaiteth them!  And they to whom knowledge hath been given see that what hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord is the truth, and that it guideth into the way of the Glorious one, the Praiseworthy
  But the unbelievers say to those whom they fall in with, "Shall we shew you a man who will foretell you that when ye shall have been utterly torn and rent to pieces, ye shall be restored in a new form?  He deviseth a lie about God, or there is a djinn in him," but they who believe not in the next life, shall incur the chastisement, and be lost in the mazes of estrangement from God
  What! have they never contemplated that which is before them and behind them, the Heaven and the Earth? If such were our pleasure, we could sink them into that Earth, or cause a portion of that Heaven to fall upon them! herein truly is a sign for our every returning servant
  Of old bestowed we on David a gift, our special boon:-"Ye mountains and ye birds answer his songs of praise
" And we made the iron soft for him:-"Make coats of mail, and arrange its plates; and work ye righteousness; for I behold your actions
"  And unto Solomon did we subject the wind, which travelled in the morning a month's journey, and a month's journey in the evening
 And we made a fountain of molten brass to flow for him
 And of the Djinn were some who worked in his presence, by the will of his Lord; and such of them as swerved from our bidding will we cause to taste the torment of the flame
  They made for him whatever he pleased, of lofty halls, and images, and dishes large as tanks for watering camels, and cooking pots that stood firmly
 "Work," said we, "O family of David with thanksgiving:" But few of my servants are the thankful!  And when we decreed the death of Solomon, nothing shewed them that he was dead but a reptile of the earth that gnawed the staff which supported his corpse
2 And when it fell, the Djinn perceived that if they had known the things unseen, they had not continued in this shameful affliction
3  A sign there was to SABA, in their dwelling places:-two gardens, the one on the right hand and the other on the left:-"Eat ye of your Lord's supplies, and give thanks to him: Goodly is the country, and gracious is the Lord!"  But they turned aside: so we sent upon them the flood of Irem;4 and we changed them their gardens into two gardens of bitter fruit and tamarisk and some few jujube trees
  Such was our retribution on them for their ingratitude: but do we thus recompense any except the ungrateful?  And we placed between them and the cities which we have blessed, conspicuous cities, and we fixed easy stages: "Travel ye through them by night and day, secure
"  But they said, "O Lord! make the distance between our journeys longer,"5-and against themselves did they act unjustly: so we made them a tale, and scattered them with an utter scattering
 Truly herein are signs to everyone that is patient, grateful
  And Eblis found that he had judged truly of them: and they all except a remnant of the faithful, followed him:  Yet no power had he over them
 Only we would discern him who believed in the life to come, from him who doubted of it; for thy Lord watcheth all things
  SAY: Call ye upon those whom ye deem gods, beside God: their power in the Heavens and in the Earth is not the weight of an atom-neither have they any share in either; nor hath He a helper from among them
  No intercession shall avail with Him but that which He shall Himself allow
 Until when at last their hearts shall be relieved from terror, they shall say, "What saith your Lord?" they shall say, "The Truth; and He is the High, the Great
"  SAY: Who supplieth you out of the Heavens and the Earth? SAY: God
 And either we or ye have guidance, or are in palpable error!  SAY: Not as to our faults shall ye be questioned; neither shall we be questioned as to your actions
  SAY: Our Lord will gather us together: then will He judge between us in justice; for He is the Judge, the Knowing!  SAY: Shew me those whom ye have united with Him as associates: Nay, rather, He is God, the Mighty, the Wise!  And we have sent thee to mankind at large, to announce and to threaten
 But most men understand not
  And they say, "When will this threat come to pass? Tell us, if ye be men of truth
"  SAY: Ye are menaced with a day, which not for an hour shall ye retard or hasten on
  The unbelievers say, "We will not believe in this Koran, nor in the Books which preceded it
" But couldst thou see when the wicked shall be set before their Lord! With reproaches will they answer one another
 The weak shall say to the mighty ones, "But for you we had been believers:"  Then shall the mighty ones say to the weak, "What! was it we who turned you aside from the guidance which had reached you? Nay, but ye acted wickedly yourselves
"  And the weak shall say to the mighty ones, "Nay, but there was a plot by night and by day, when ye bad us believe not in God, and gave him peers
" And they shall proclaim their repentance after they have seen the punishment! And yokes will we place on the necks of those who have not believed! Shall they be rewarded but as they have wrought?  And never have we sent a warner to any city whose opulent men did not say, "In sooth we disbelieve your message
"  And they said, "We are the more abundant in riches and in children, nor shall we be among the punished
"  SAY: Of a truth my Lord will be liberal or sparing in his supplies to whom he pleaseth: but the greater part of men acknowledge it not
  Neither by your riches nor by your children shall you bring yourselves into nearness with Us; but they who believe and do the thing that is right shall have a double reward for what they shall have done: and in the pavilions of Paradise shall they dwell secure!  But they who shall aim to invalidate our signs, shall be consigned to punishment
  SAY: Of a truth my Lord will be liberal in supplies to whom he pleaseth of his servants, or will be sparing to him: and whatever ye shall give in alms he will return; and He is the best dispenser of gifts
  One day he will gather them all together: then shall he say to the angels, "Did these worship you?"  They shall say, "Glory be to thee! Thou art our master, not these! But they worshipped the Djinn: it was in them that most of them believed
  On this day the one of you shall have no power over others for help or hurt
 And we will say to the evil doers, "Taste ye the torment of the fire, which ye treated as a delusion
"  For when our distinct signs are recited to them, they say, "This is merely a man who would fain pervert you from your father's Worship
" And they say, "This (Koran) is no other than a forged falsehood
" And the unbelievers say to the truth when it is presented to them, "Tis nothing but palpable sorcery
"  Yet have we given them no books in which to study deeply, nor have we sent any one to them before thee, charged with warnings
  They also flourished before them, treated our apostles as impostors in like sort: but not to the tenth part of what we bestowed on them,6 have these attained
 And yet when they charged my apostles with deceit, how terrible was my vengeance:  SAY: One thing in sooth do I advise you:-that ye stand up before God two and two, or singly,7 and then reflect that in your fellow citizen is no djinn:8 he is no other than your warner before a severe punishment
  SAY: I ask not any wage from you: keep it for yourselves: my wage is from God alone
 And He is witness over all things!  SAY: Truly my Lord sendeth forth the Truth:-Knower of things unseen!  SAY: Truth is come, and falsehood shall vanish and return no more
  SAY: If I err, verily to my own cost only shall I err: but if I have guidance, it will be of my Lord's revealing, for He is the Hearer, the near at hand
  Couldst thou see how they shall tremble and find no escape, and be taken forth from the place that is so near;9  And shall say, "We believe in Him!" But how, in their present distance, shall they receive the faith,  When they had before denied it, and aimed their shafts at the mysteries from afar?10  And a gulf shall be between them and that which they shall desire-  As was done unto their likes of old, who were lost in the questionings of doubt

-THE CREATOR, OR THE ANGELS [LXXXVI
]  MECCA
-45 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  PRAISE be to God, Maker of the Heavens and of the Earth! Who employeth the ANGELS as envoys, with pairs of wings, two, three, and four: He addeth to his creature what He will! Truly God hath power for all things
  The mercy which God layeth open for man, no one can keep back; and what He shall keep back, none can afterwards send forth
 And He is the Mighty, the Wise
  O men! bear in mind the favour of God towards you
 Is there a creator other than God, who nourisheth you with the gifts of heaven and earth? There is no God but He! How then are ye turned aside from Him?  If they treat thee as an impostor, then before thee have apostles been treated as impostors
 But to God shall all things return
  O men! assuredly the promise of God is true: let not then the present life deceive you: and let not the Deceiver deceive you as to God
  Yes, Satan is your foe
 For a foe then hold him
 He calleth his followers to him that they may become inmates of the flame
  The unbelievers,-for them a terrible punishment!  But believers and doers of good works, for them is mercy, and a great reward!  Shall he, the evil of whose deeds are so tricked out to him that he deemeth them good, be treated like him who seeth things aright? Verily God misleadeth whom He will, and guideth whom He will
 Spend not thy soul in sighs for them: God knoweth their doings
  It is God who sendeth forth the winds which raise the clouds aloft: then drive we them on to some land dead from drought,1 and give life thereby to the earth after its death
 So shall be the resurrection
  If any one desireth greatness, all greatness is in God
 The good word riseth up to Him, and the righteous deed will He exalt
 But a severe punishment awaiteth the plotters of evil things; and the plots of such will He render vain
  Moreover, God created you of dust-then of the germs of life-then made you two sexes: and no female conceiveth or bringeth forth without his knowledge; and the aged ageth not, nor is aught minished from man's age, but in accordance with the Book
 An easy thing truly is this to God
  Nor are the two seas2 alike: the one fresh, sweet, pleasant for drink, and the other salt, bitter; yet from both ye eat fresh fish, and take forth for you ornaments to wear, and thou seest the ships cleaving their waters that ye may go in quest of his bounties, and that ye may be thankful
  He causeth the night to enter in upon the day, and the day to enter in upon the night; and He hath given laws to the sun and to the moon, so that each journeyeth to its appointed goal: This is God your Lord: All power is His: But the gods whom ye call on beside Him have no power over the husk of a date stone!  If ye cry to them they will not hear your cry; and if they heard they would not answer you, and in the day of resurrection they will disown your joining them with God: and none can instruct thee like Him who is informed of all
  O men! ye are but paupers in need of God; but God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy!  If He please, He could sweep you away, and bring forth a new creation!  Nor will this be hard for God
  And the burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: and if the heavy laden soul cry out for its burden to be carried, yet shall not aught of it be carried, even by the near of kin! Thou shalt warn those who fear their Lord in secret, and observe prayer
 And whoever shall keep himself pure, he purifieth himself to his own behoof: for unto God shall be the final gathering
  And the blind and the seeing are not alike; neither darkness and light; nor the shade and the hot wind;  Nor are the living and the dead the same thing! God indeed shall make whom He will to hearken, but thou shalt not make those who are in their graves to hearken; for only with warning art thou charged
  Verily we have sent thee with the truth; a bearer of good tidings and a warner; nor hath there been a people unvisited by its warner
  And if they treat thee as a liar, so did those who were before them threat their Apostles who came to them with the proofs of their mission, and with the Scriptures and with the enlightening Book:3  Then chastised I the unbelievers: and how great was my vengeance!  Seest thou not how that God sendeth down water from the Heaven, and that by it we cause the up-growth of fruits of varied hues, and that on the mountains4 are tracks of varied hues, white and red, and others are of a raven black? And of men and reptiles and animals, various likewise are the hues
 Such only of his servants as are possessed of knowledge fear God
 Lo! God is Mighty, Gracious!  Verily they who recite the Book of God, and observe prayer, and give alms in public and in private from what we have bestowed upon them, may hope for a merchandise that shall not perish:  God will certainly pay them their due wages, and of his bounty increase them: for He is Gracious, Grateful
  And that which we have revealed to thee of the Book is the very Truth, confirmatory of previous Scriptures: for God knoweth and beholdeth his servants
  Moreover, we have made the Book an heritage to those of our servants whom we have chosen
 Some of them injure themselves by evil deeds; others keep the midway between good and evil; and others, by the permission of God, outstrip in goodness; this is the great merit!  Into the gardens of Eden shall they enter: with bracelets of gold and pearl shall they be decked therein, and therein shall their raiment be of silk:  And they shall say, "Praise be to God who hath put away sorrow from us
 Verily our Lord is Gracious, Grateful,  Who of His bounty hath placed us in a manison that shall abide for ever: therein no toil shall reach us, and therein no weariness shall touch us
"  But for infidels is the fire of Hell; to die shall never be decreed them, nor shall aught of its torment be made light to them
 Thus reward we every infidel!  And therein shall they cry aloud, "Take us hence, O our Lord! righteousness will we work, and not what we wrought of old
"-"Prolonged we not your days that whoever would be warned might be warned therein? And the preacher came to you-  Taste it then
"-There is no protector for the unjust
  God truly knoweth the hidden things both of the Heavens and of the Earth: for He knoweth the very secrets of the breast
  He hath appointed you his vicegerents in the earth: And whoever believeth not, on him shall be his unbelief; and their unbelief shall only increase for the unbelievers, hatred at the hands of their Lord:-and their unbelief shall only increase for the unbelievers their own perdition!  SAY: What think ye of the gods whom ye invoke beside God? Shew me what part of the earth they have created? Had they a share in the creation of the Heavens? Have we given them a Book in which they can find proofs that they are to be called on? Nay, the wicked promise one another only deceits
  Verily God holdeth fast the Heavens and the Earth that they pass not away: and if they were passing away none could hold them back but He: for He is Kind, Gracious
  They swore by God with their mightiest oath that should a preacher come to them they would yield to guidance more than any people: but when the preacher came to them it only increased in them their estrangement,  Their haughtiness on earth and their plotting of evil! But the plotting of evil shall only enmesh those who make use of it
5 Look they then for aught but God's way6 of dealing with the peoples of old? Thou shalt not find any change in the way of God,-  Yea, thou shalt not find any variableness in the way of God
  Have they never journeyed in the land and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them, though mightier in strength than they? God is not to be frustrated by aught in the Heavens or in the Earth; for He is the All-knowing, the All-mighty
  If, moreover, God should chastise men according to their deserts, He would not leave even a reptile on the back of the earth! But to an appointed time doth He respite them
  And when their time shall come, then verily God's eye is on his servants

1 A Book hath been sent down to thee: therefore let there be no difficulty in thy breast concerning it: to the intent that thou mayest warn thereby, and that it may be a monition to the faithful
  Follow ye what hath been sent down to you from your Lord; and follow no masters beside Him
 How little will ye be monished!  How many cities have we destroyed! By night, or while they were in their midday slumber, did our wrath reach them!  And what was their cry when our wrath reached them, but to say, "Verily, we have been impious
"  Surely, therefore, will we call those to account, to whom an Apostle hath been sent, and of the sent ones themselves will we certainly demand a reckoning
  And with knowledge will we tell them of their deeds, for we were not absent from them
  The weighing2 on that day, with justice! and they whose balances shall be heavy, these are they who shall be happy
  And they whose balances shall be light, these are they who have lost their souls, for that to our signs they were unjust:  And now have we stabilished you on the earth, and given you therein the supports of life
 How little do ye give thanks!  We created you; then fashioned you; then said we to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves unto Adam: and they prostrated them all in worship, save Eblis: He was not among those who prostrated themselves
  To him said God: "What hath hindered thee from prostrating thyself in worship at my bidding?" He said, "Nobler am I than he: me hast thou created of fire; of clay hast thou created him
"  He said, "Get thee down hence: Paradise is no place for thy pride: Get thee gone then; one of the despised shalt thou be
"  He said, "Respite me till the day when mankind shall be raised from the dead
"  He said, "One of the respited shalt thou be
"  He said, "Now, for that thou hast caused me to err, surely in thy straight path will I lay wait for them:  Then will I surely come upon them from before, and from behind, and from their right hand, and from their left, and thou shalt not find the greater part of them to be thankful
"  He said, "Go forth from it, a scorned, a banished one! Whoever of them shall follow thee, I will surely fill hell with you, one and all
  And, O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in Paradise, and eat ye whence ye will, but to this tree approach not, lest ye become of the unjust doers
"  Then Satan whispered them to shew them their nakedness, which had been hidden from them both
 And he said, "This tree3 hath your Lord forbidden you, only lest ye should become angels, or lest ye should become immortals
"  And he sware to them both, "Verily I am unto you one who counselleth aright
"  So he beguiled them by deceits: and when they had tasted of the tree, their nakedness appeared to them, and they began to sew together upon themselves the leaves of the garden
 And their Lord called to them, "Did I not forbid you this tree, and did I not say to you, 'Verily, Satan is your declared enemy
' "  They said, "O our Lord! With ourselves have we dealt unjustly: if thou forgive us not and have pity on us, we shall surely be of those who perish
"  He said, "Get ye down, the one of you an enemy4 to the other; and on earth shall be your dwelling, and your provision for a season
"  He said, "On it shall ye live, and on it shall ye die, and from it shall ye be taken forth
"  O children of Adam! now have we sent down to you raiment to hide your nakedness, and splendid garments; but the raiment of piety-this is best
 This is one of the signs of God, that man haply may reflect
  O children of Adam! let not Satan bring you into trouble, as he drove forth your parents from the Garden, by despoiling them of their raiment, that he might cause them to see their nakedness: He truly seeth you, he and his comrades, whence ye see not them
 Verily, we have made the Satans tutelars of those who believe not
  And when the wicked commit some filthy deed, they say, "We found our fathers practising it, and to us hath God commanded it"-SAY: God enjoineth not filthy deeds
 Will ye speak of God ye know not what?  SAY: My Lord hath enjoined what is right
 Turn your faces therefore towards every place where he is worshipped5 and call upon him with sincere religion
 As he created you, to him shall ye return: some hath he guided, and some hath he justly left in error, because they have taken the Satans as their tutelars beside God, and have deemed that they were guided aright
  O children of Adam! wear your goodly apparel when ye repair to any mosque,6 and eat ye and drink; but exceed not, for He loveth not those who exceed
  SAY: Who hath prohibited God's goodly raiment, and the healthful viands which He hath provided for his servants? SAY: These are for the faithful in this present life, but above all on the day of the resurrection
 Thus make we our signs plain for people of knowledge
  SAY: Truly my Lord hath forbidden filthy actions whether open or secret, and iniquity, and unjust violence, and to associate with God that for which He hath sent down no warranty, and to speak of God that ye know not
  Every nation hath its set time
 And when their time is come, they shall not retard it an hour; and they shall not advance it
  O children of Adam! there shall come to you Apostles from among yourselves, rehearsing my signs to you; and whoso shall fear God and do good works, no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they be put to grief
  But they who charge our signs with falsehood, and turn away from them in their pride, shall be inmates of the fire: for ever shall they abide therein
  And who is worse than he who deviseth a lie of God, or treateth our signs as lies? To them shall a portion here below be assigned in accordance with the Book of our decrees, until the time when our messengers,7 as they receive their souls, shall say, "Where are they on whom ye called beside God?" They shall say: "Gone from us
" And they shall witness against themselves that they were infidels
  He shall say, "Enter ye into the Fire with the generations of Djinn and men who have preceded you
 So oft as a fresh generation entereth, it shall curse its sister, until when they have all reached it, the last comers shall say to the former, 'O our Lord! these are they who led us astray: assign them therefore a double torment of the fire:"' He will say, "Ye shall all have double
" But of this are ye ignorant
  And the former of them shall say to the latter, "What advantage have ye over us? Taste ye therefore the torment for that which ye have done
"  Verily, they who have charged our signs with falsehood and have turned away from them in their pride, Heaven's gates shall not be opened to them, nor shall they enter Paradise, until the camel8 passeth through the eye of the needle
 After this sort will we recompense the transgressors
  They shall make their bed in Hell, and above them shall be coverings of fire! After this sort will we recompense the evil doers
  But as to those who have believed and done the things which are right (we will lay on no one a burden beyond his power) These shall be inmates of Paradise: for ever shall they abide therein;  And we will remove whatever rancour was in their bosoms: rivers shall roll at their feet: and they shall say, "Praise be to God who hath guided us hither! We had not been guided had not God guided us! Of a surety the Apostles of our Lord came to us with truth
" And a voice shall cry to them, "This is Paradise, of which, as the meed of your works, ye are made heirs
"  And the inmates of Paradise shall cry to the inmates of the fire, "Now have we found what our Lord promised us to be true
 Have ye too found what your Lord promised you to be true?" And they shall answer, "Yes
" And a Herald shall proclaim between them: "The curse of God be upon the evil doers,  Who turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked, and who believe not in the life to come!"  And between them shall be a partition; and on the wall AL ARAF9 shall be men who will know all,10 by their tokens, and they shall cry to the inmates of Paradise, "Peace be on you!" but they shall not yet enter it, although they long to do so
  And when their eyes are turned towards the inmates of the Fire, they shall say, "O our Lord! place us not with the offending people
"  And they who are upon Al Araf shall cry to those whom they shall know by their tokens, "Your amassings and your pride have availed you nothing
  Are these they on whom ye sware God would not bestow mercy? Enter ye11 into Paradise! where no fear shall be upon you, neither shall ye be put to grief
"  And the inmates of the fire shall cry to the inmates of Paradise: "Pour upon us some water, or of the refreshments12 God hath given you?" They shall say, "Truly God hath forbidden both to unbelievers,  Who made their religion a sport and pastime, and whom the life of the world hath deceived
" This day therefore will we forget them, as they forgot the meeting of this their day, and as they did deny our signs
  And now have we brought them the Book: with knowledge have we explained it; a guidance and a mercy to them that believe
  What have they to wait for now but its interpretation? When its interpretation13 shall come, they who aforetime were oblivious of it shall say, "The Prophets of our Lord did indeed bring the truth; shall we have any intercessor to intercede for us? or could we not be sent back? Then would we act otherwise than we have acted
" But they have ruined themselves; and the deities of their own devising have fled from them!  Your Lord is God, who in six days created the Heavens and the Earth, and then mounted the throne: He throweth the veil of night over the day: it pursueth it swiftly: and he created the sun and the moon and the stars, subjected to laws by His behest: Is not all creation and its empire His? Blessed be God the Lord of the Worlds!  Call upon your Lord with lowliness and in secret, for He loveth not transgressors
  And commit not disorders on the earth after it hath been well ordered; and call on Him with fear and longing desire: Verily the mercy of God is nigh unto the righteous
  And He it is who sendeth forth the winds as the heralds of his compassion,14 until they bring up the laden clouds, which we drive along to some dead land and send down water thereon, by which we cause an upgrowth of all kinds of fruit
-Thus will we bring forth the dead
 Haply ye will reflect
  In a rich soil, its plants spring forth abundantly by the will of its Lord, and in that which is bad, they spring forth but scantily
 Thus do We diversify our signs for those who are thankful
  Of old sent We Noah to his people,15 and he said, "O my people! worship God
 Ye have no God but Him: indeed I fear for you the chastisement of the great day
"  The chiefs of his people said, "We clearly see that thou art in a palpable error
"  He said, "There is no error in me, O my people! but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
  I bring to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you friendly counsel; for I know from God what ye know not
  Marvel ye that a Warning should come to you from your Lord through one of yourselves, that he may warn you, and that ye may fear for yourselves, and that haply ye may find mercy?"  But they treated him as a liar: so we delivered him and those who were with him in the ark, and we drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood; for they were a blind people
  And to Ad16 we sent their brother Houd
17 "O my people!" said he, "worship God: ye have no other god than Him: Will ye not then fear Him?"  Said the unbelieving chiefs among his people, "We certainly perceive that thou art unsound of mind; and we surely deem thee an impostor
"  He said, "O my people! it is not unsoundness of mind in me, but I am an Apostle from the Lord of the Worlds
  The messages of my Lord do I announce to you, and I am your faithful18 counsellor
  Marvel ye that a warning hath come to you from your Lord through one of yourselves that He may warn you? Remember how he hath made you the successors of the people of Noah, and increased you in tallness of stature
 Remember then the favours of God, that it may haply be well with you
"  They said, "Art thou come to us in order that we may worship one God alone, and leave what our fathers worshipped? Then bring that upon us with which thou threatenest us, if thou be a man of truth
"  He said, "Vengeance and wrath shall suddenly light on you from your Lord
 Do ye dispute with me about names that you and your fathers have given your idols, and for which God hath sent you down no warranty? Wait ye then, and I too will wait with you
"  And we delivered him, and those who were on his side, by our mercy, and we cut off, to the last man, those who had treated our signs as lies, and who were not believers
  And to Themoud we sent their brother Saleh
19 He said, O my people! worship God: ye have no other god than Him: now hath a clear proof of my mission come to you from your Lord, this she-camel of God being a sign to you: therefore let her go at large to pasture on God's earth: and touch her not to harm her, lest a grievous chastisement seize you
  And remember how he hath made you successors to the Adites, and given you dwellings on the earth, so that on its plains ye build castles, and hew out houses in the hills
 And bear in mind the benefits of God, and lay not the earth waste with deeds of licence
  Said the chiefs of his people puffed up with pride, to those who were esteemed weak, even to those of them who believed, "What! know ye for certain that Saleh is sent by his Lord?" They said, "Truly we believe in that with which he hath been sent
"  Then said those proud men, "Verily, we reject that in which ye believe
"  And they ham-strung the she-camel, and rebelled against their Lord's command, and said, "O Saleh, let thy menaces be accomplished upon us if thou art one of the Sent Ones
"  Then the earthquake surprised them; and in the morning they were found dead on their faces in their dwellings
  So he turned away from them, and said, "O my people! I did indeed announce to you the message of my Lord: and I gave you faithful counsel, but ye love not faithful counsellors
20  We also sent Lot, when he said to his people, commit ye this filthy deed in which no creature hath gone before you?  Come ye to men, instead of women, lustfully? Ye are indeed a people given up to excess
  But the only answer of his people was to say, "Turn them out of your city, for they are men who vaunt them pure
"  And we delivered him and his family, except his wife; she was of those who lingered:  And we rained a rain upon them: and see what was the end of the wicked!  And we sent to Madian21 their brother Shoaib
 He said, "O my people! worship God; ye have no other God than Him: now hath a clear sign come to you from your Lord: give therefore the full in measures and weights; take from no man his chattels, and commit no disorder on the earth after it has been made so good
 This will be better for you, if you will believe it
  And lay not in ambush by every road in menacing sort; nor mislead him who believeth in God, from His way, nor seek to make it crooked; and remember when ye were few and that he multiplied you, and behold what hath been the end of the authors of disorder!  And if a part of you believe in that with which I am sent, and a part of you believe not, then wait steadfastly until God shall judge between us, for He is the best of judges
"  Said the chiefs of his people puffed up with pride, "We will surely banish thee, O Shoaib, and thy fellow-believers from our cities, unless indeed ye shall come back to our religion
" "What!" said he, "though we abhor it?  Now shall we have devised a lie concerning God, if after he hath delivered us from your religion we shall return to it; nor can we return to it, unless by the will of God our Lord: our Lord embraceth all things in his ken
 In God have we put our trust: O our Lord! decide between us and between our people, with truth; for the best to decide art Thou
"  And the chiefs of his people who believed not, said, "If ye follow Shoaib, ye shall then surely perish
"  An earthquake therefore surprised them, and they were found in the morning dead on their faces, in their dwellings
  Those who had treated Shoaib as an impostor, became as though they had never dwelt in them: they who treated Shoaib as an impostor, were they that perished
  So he turned away from them and said, O my people! I proclaimed to you the messages of my Lord, and I counselled you aright; but how should I be grieved for a people who do not believe?  Nor did we ever send a prophet to any city without afflicting its people with adversity and trouble, that haply they might humble them
22  Then changed we their ill for good, until they waxed wealthy, and said, "Of old did troubles and blessings befall our fathers:" therefore did we seize upon them suddenly when they were unaware
  But if that the people of these cities had believed and feared us, we would surely have laid open to them blessings out of the Heaven and the Earth: but they treated our signs as lies, and we took vengeance on them for their deeds
  Were the people, therefore, of those cities secure that our wrath would not light on them by night, while they were slumbering?  Were the people of those cities secure that our wrath would not light on them in broad day, while they were disporting themselves?  Did they, therefore, deem themselves secure from the deep counsel23 of God? But none deem themselves secure from the deep counsel of God, save those who perish
  Is it not proved to those who inherit this land after its ancient occupants, that if we please we can smite them for their sins, and put a seal upon their hearts, that they hearken not?  We will tell thee the stories of these cities
 Their apostles came to them with clear proofs of their mission; but they would not believe in what they had before treated as imposture
-Thus doth God seal up the hearts of the unbelievers-  And we found not of their covenant in most of them; but we found most of them to be perverse
  Then after them we sent Moses with our signs to Pharaoh and his nobles, who acted unjustly in their regard
 But see what was the end of the corrupt doers!  And Moses said, "O Pharaoh! verily I am an apostle from the Lord of the Worlds
  Nothing but truth is it right for me to speak of God
 Now am I come to you from your Lord with a proof of my mission; send away, therefore, the children of Israel with me
" He said, "If thou comest with a sign, shew it if thou art a man of truth
"  So he threw down his rod, and lo! it distinctly became a serpent
  Then drew he forth his hand, and lo! it was white24 to the beholders
  The nobles of Pharaoh's people said, "Verily, this is an expert enchanter:  Fain would he expel you from your land: what then do ye order to be done?"  They said, "Put25 him and his brother off awhile, and send round men to your cities who shall muster  And bring to thee every skilled enchanter
"  And the enchanters came to Pharaoh
 Said they, "Shall we surely be rewarded if we prevail?"  He said, "Yes; and ye certainly shall be near my person
"  They said, "O Moses! either cast thou down thy rod first, or we will cast down ours
"  He said, "Cast ye down
" And when they had cast them down they enchanted the people's eyes, and made them afraid; for they had displayed a great enchantment
  Then spake we unto Moses, "Throw down thy rod;" and lo! it devoured their lying wonders
  So the truth was made strong, and that which they had wrought proved vain:  And they were vanquished on the spot, and drew back humiliated
  But the other enchanters prostrated themselves adoring:  Said they, "We believe on the Lord of the Worlds,  The Lord of Moses and Aaron
"  Said Pharaoh, "Have ye believed on him, ere I have given you leave? This truly is a plot which ye have plotted in this my city, in order to drive out its people
 But ye shall see in the end what shall happen
  I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides; then will I have you all crucified
"  They said, "Verily, to our Lord do we return;  And thou takest vengeance on us only because we have believed on the signs of our Lord when they came to us
 Lord! pour out constancy upon us, and cause us to die Muslims
"  Then said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people-"Wilt thou let Moses and his people go to spread disorders in our land, and desert thee and thy gods?" He said, "We will cause their male children to be slain and preserve their females alive: and verily we shall be masters over them
"  Said Moses to his people, "Cry unto God for help, and bear up patiently, for the earth is God's: to such of His servants as He pleaseth doth He give it as a heritage; and for those that fear Him is a happy issue
"  "We have been oppressed," they said, "before thou camest to us, and since thou hast been with us:" "Perhaps," said he, "your Lord will destroy your enemy, and will make you his successors in the land, and He will see how ye will act therein
"  Already had we chastised the people of Pharaoh with dearth and scarcity of fruits, that haply they might take warning:  And when good fell to their lot they said, "This is our due
" But if ill befel them, they regarded Moses and his partisans as (the birds) of evil omen
26 Yet, was not their evil omen from God? But most of them knew it not
  And they said, "Whatever sign thou bring us for our enchantment, we will not believe on thee
"  And we sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the kummal (lice) and the frogs and the blood,-clear signs27-but they behaved proudly, and were a sinful people
  And when any plague fell upon them, they said, "O Moses! pray for us to thy Lord, according to that which he hath covenanted with thee: Truly if thou take off the plague from us, we will surely believe thee, and will surely send the children of Israel with thee
" But when we had taken off the plague from them, and the time which God had granted them had expired,28 behold! they broke their promise
  Therefore we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated our signs as falsehoods and were heedless of them
  And we gave to the people who had been brought so low, the eastern and the western lands, which we had blessed as an heritage: and the good word of thy Lord was fulfilled on the children of Israel because they had borne up with patience: and we destroyed the works and the structures of Pharaoh and his people:  And we brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who gave themselves up to their idols
 They said, "O Moses! make us a god, as they have gods
" He said, "Verily, ye are an ignorant people:  For the worship they practise29 will be destroyed, and that which they do, is vain
"  He said, "Shall I seek any other god for you than God, when it is He who hath preferred you above all other peoples?"  And remember when we rescued you from the people of Pharaoh they had laid on you a cruel affliction; they slew your sons, and let only your daughters live, and in this was a great trial from your Lord
  And we appointed a meeting with Moses for thirty nights, which we completed with ten other nights, so that his whole time with his Lord30 amounted to forty nights
 Then said Moses to his brother Aaron, "Take thou my place among my people, and act rightly, and follow not the way of the corrupt doers
"  And when Moses came at our set time and his Lord spake with him, he said, "O Lord, shew thyself to me, that I may look upon thee
" He said, "Thou shalt not see Me; but look towards the mount, and if it abide firm in its place, then shalt thou see Me
" And when God manifested Himself to the mountain he turned it to dust! and Moses fell in a swoon
  And when he came to himself, he said, "Glory be to thee! To thee do I turn in penitence, and I am the first of them that believe
"  He said, "O Moses! thee above all men have I chosen by my commissions, and by my speaking to thee
 Take therefore what I have brought thee, and be one of those who render thanks
  And we wrote for him upon the tables a monition concerning every matter, and said, "Receive them thyself with steadfastness, and command thy people to receive them for the observance of its most goodly precepts:-I will shew you the abode of the wicked
"  The unjustly proud ones of the earth will I turn aside from my signs, for even if they see every sign they will not believe them; and if they see the path of uprightness, they will not take it for their path, but if they see the path of error, for their path will they take it
  This,-for that they treated our signs as lies, and were heedless of them
  Vain will be the works of those who treated our signs, and the meeting of the life to come, as lies! Shall they be rewarded but as they have wrought?  And the people of Moses took during his absence a calf made of their ornaments, and ruddy like gold, and lowing
31 Saw they not that it could not speak to them, nor guide them in the way?  Yet they took if for a God and became offenders!  But when they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said, Truly if our Lord have not mercy on us, and forgive us, we shall surely be of those who perish
  And when Moses returned to his people, wrathful, angered, he said, "Evil is it that ye have done next upon my departure
 Would ye hasten on the judgments of your Lord?" And he threw down the tables, and seized his brother by the head and dragged him unto him
 Said he, "Son of my mother! the people thought me weak, and had well nigh slain me
 Make not mine enemies to rejoice over me, and place me not among the wrong doers
"  He said, "O Lord, forgive me and my brother, and bring us into thy mercy; for of those who shew mercy thou art the most merciful
"  Verily as to those who took the calf as a god, wrath from their Lord shall overtake them, and shame in this present life: for thus recompense we the devisers of a lie
  But to those who have done evil, then afterwards repent and believe, thy Lord will thereafter be Lenient, Merciful
  And when the anger of Moses was stilled, he took up the tables; and in their writing was guidance and mercy for those who dread their Lord
  And Moses chose seventy men of his people for a meeting appointed by us
 And when the earthquake overtook them, he said, "O my Lord! if it had been thy pleasure, thou hadst destroyed them and me ere this! wilt thou destroy us for what our foolish ones have done? It is nought but thy trial: thou wilt mislead by it whom thou wilt, and guide whom thou wilt
 Our guardian, thou! Forgive us then and have mercy on us; for of those who forgive art thou the best:  And write down for us what is good in this world, as well as in the world to come, for to thee are we guided
" He said, "My chastisement shall fall on whom I will, and my mercy embraceth all things, and I write it down for those who shall fear me, and pay the alms, and believe in our signs,  Who shall follow the Apostle, the unlettered32 Prophet-whom they shall find described with them in the Law and Evangel
 What is right will he enjoin them, and forbid them what is wrong, and will allow them healthful viands and prohibit the impure, and will ease them of their burden, and of the yokes which were upon them; and those who shall believe in him, and strengthen him, and help him,33 and follow the light34 which hath been sent down with him,- these are they with whom it shall be well
"  SAY to them: O men! Verily I am God's apostle to you all;  Whose is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! Therefore believe on God but He! He maketh alive and killeth! Therefore believe on God, and his Apostle-the unlettered Prophet-who believeth in God and his word
 And follow him that ye may be guided aright
  And among the people of Moses there is a certain number35 who guide others with truth, and practise what is right according to it
  And we divided the Israelites into twelve tribes, as nations; and we revealed unto Moses when the people asked drink of him-"Strike the rock with thy staff:" and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains-the men all knew their drinking places
 And we caused clouds to overshadow them, and sent down upon them the manna and the quails
 
 
 
  "Eat of the good things with which we have supplied you
" But it was not us whom they injured, but they injured their own selves:  And when it was said to them, "Dwell in this city, and eat therefrom what ye will, and say 'Hittat' (forgiveness), and enter the gate with prostrations; then will we pardon your offences,-we will give increase to the doers of good:"  But the ungodly ones among them changed that word into another than that which had been told them:36 therefore sent we forth wrath out of Heaven upon them for their wrong doings
  And37 ask them about the city that stood by the sea, when its inhabitants broke the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day appearing openly, but came not to them on the day when they kept no Sabbath
 Thus did we make trial of them, for that they were evildoers
38  And when some of them said, why warn ye those whom God would destroy or chastise with terrible chastisement? they said, For our own excuse with your Lord; and that they may fear Him
  And when they forgot their warnings, we delivered those who had forbidden evil; and we inflicted a severe chastisement on those who had done wrong, for that they were evil doers
  But when they proudly persisted in that which was forbidden, we said to them, "Become scouted apes;" and then thy Lord declared that until the day of the resurrection, he would surely send against them39 (the Jews) those who should evil entreat and chastise them: for prompt is thy Lord to punish; and He is Forgiving, Merciful
  And we have divided them upon the Earth as peoples: some of them are upright and some are otherwise; and by good things and by evil things have we proved them, to the intent that they might return to us
  And they have had successors to succeed them: they have inherited the Book: they have received the passing good things of this lower world,40 and say, "It will be forgiven us
" Yet if the like good things came to them again, they would again receive them
 But hath there not been received on their part a covenant through the Scripture that they should speak nought of God but the truth? And yet they study its contents
 But the mansion of the next world hath more value for those who fear God-Do ye not then comprehend?-  And who hold fast the Book, and observe prayer: verily, we will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish
  And when we shook the mount41 over them as if it had been a shadow, and they thought it falling upon them, 
 
 
  "Receive, said we, with steadfastness what we have brought you, and remember what is therein to the end that ye may fear God
"  And when thy Lord brought forth their descendants from the reins of the sons of Adam and took them to witness against themselves, "Am I not," said He, "your Lord?" They said, "Yes, we witness it
" This we did, lest ye should say on the day of Resurrection, "Truly, of this were we heedless, because uninformed;"  Or lest ye should say, "Our fathers, indeed, aforetime joined other gods with our God, and we are their seed after them: wilt thou destroy us for the doings of vain men?"  Thus make we our signs clear: that haply they may return to God
  Recite to them42 the history of him43 to whom we vouchsafed our signs, and who departed from them, so that Satan followed him, and he became one of the seduced
  Had we pleased, we had certainly thereby exalted him; but he crouched to the earth and followed his own lust: his likeness, therefore, is as that of the dog which lolls out his tongue, whether thou chase him away, or leave him alone! Such is the likeness of those who treat our signs as lies
 Tell them this tale then, that they may consider
  Evil the likeness of those who treat our signs as lies! and it is themselves they injure
  He whom God guideth is the guided, and they whom he misleadeth shall be the lost
  Many, moreover, of the Djinn and men have we created for Hell
 Hearts have they with which they understand not, and eyes have they with which they see not, and ears have they with which they hearken not
 They are like the brutes: Yea, they go more astray: these are the heedless
  Most excellent titles hath God:44 by these call ye on Him, and stand aloof from those who pervert45 his titles
 For what they have done shall they be repaid!  And among those whom we have created are a people who guide others with truth, and in accordance therewith act justly
  But as for those who treat our signs as lies, we will gradually bring them down by means of which they know not:  And though I lengthen their days, verily, my stratagem shall prove effectual
  Will they not bethink them that their companion Muhammad is not djinn- possessed? Yes, his office is only that of plain warner
  Will they not look forth on the realms of the Heaven and of the Earth, and on all things which God hath made, to see whether haply their end be not drawing on? And in what other book will they believe46 who reject the Koran?  No other guide for him whom God shall mislead! He will leave them distraught in their wanderings
  They will ask thee of the Hour-for what time is its coming fixed? SAY: The knowledge of it is only with my Lord: none shall manifest it in its time but He: it is the burden47 of the Heavens and of the Earth: not otherwise than on a sudden will it come on you
48  They will ask thee as if thou wast privy to it: SAY: The knowledge of it is with none but God
 But most men know not this
  SAY: I have no control over what may be helpful or hurtful to me, but as God willeth
 Had I the knowledge of his secrets, I should revel in the good, and evil should not touch me
 But I am only a warner, and an announcer of good tidings to those who believe
  He it is who hath created you from a single person, and from him brought forth his wife that he might dwell with her: and when he had known her, she bore a light burden, and went about with it; and when it became heavy, they both cried to God their Lord, "If thou give us a perfect child we will surely be of the thankful
"  Yet when God had given them a perfect child,49 they50 joined partners with Him in return for what he had given them
 But high is God above the partners they joined with Him!  What! Will they join those with Him who cannot create anything, and are themselves created, and have no power to help them, or to help themselves?  And if ye summon them to "the guidance," they will not follow you! It is the same to them whether ye summon them or whether ye hold your peace!  Truly they whom ye call on beside God, are, like yourselves, His servants! Call on them then, and let them answer you, if what ye say of them be true!  Have they feet to walk with? Have they hands to hold with? Have they eyes to see with? Have they ears to hear with? SAY: Call on these joint gods of yours; then make your plot against me, and delay it not
  Verily, my Lord is God, who hath sent down "the Book;" and He is the protector of the righteous
  But they whom ye call on beside Him, can lend you no help, nor can they help themselves:  And if ye summon them to "the guidance," they hear you not: thou seest them look towards thee, but they do not see!  Make the best of things;51 and enjoin what is just, and withdraw from the ignorant:  And if stirrings to evil from Satan stir thee, fly thou for refuge to God: He verily heareth, knoweth!  Verily, they who fear God, when some phantom from Satan toucheth them, remember Him, and lo! they see clearly
  Their Brethren52 will only continue them in error, and cannot preserve themselves from it
  And when thou bringest not a verse (sign) of the Koran to them, they say, "Hast thou not yet patched it up?53 SAY: I only follow my Lord's utterances to me
 This is a clear proof on the part of your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for those who believe
  And when the Koran is read, then listen ye to it and keep silence, that haply ye may obtain mercy
  And think within thine own self on God, with lowliness and with fear and without loud spoken words, at even and at morn; and be not one of the heedless
  Verily they who are round about thy Lord disdain not His service
 They praise Him and prostrate themselves before Him

 The Koreisch (we are told in Sirat Arrasul, fol

 It is equivalent to the Gr

 There can, however, be no doubt that Muhammad-in spite of his assertions to the contrary, with the view of proving his inspiration-was well acquainted with the Bible histories

 MIM
1 The Revelation (sending down) of this Book is from the Mighty, the Wise!  We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and all that is between them otherwise than in truth and for a settled term
 But they who believe not, turn away from their warning
  SAY: What think ye? As for those whom ye invoke beside God, shew me what part of the earth it is which they have created? Had they a share in the Heavens? Bring me a Book sent down by them before this Koran, or traces of their knowledge;2-if ye are men of truth
  And who erreth more than he who, beside God, calleth upon that which shall not answer him until the day of Resurrection? Yes, they regard not their invocations;  And when mankind shall be assembled together, they will become their enemies, and ungratefully disown their worship
  And when our clear signs are recited to them, they who believe not say of the truth when it cometh to them, "This is plain sorcery
"  Will they say, "He hath devised It?" SAY: If I have devised the Koran, then not one single thing shall ye ever obtain for me from God! He best knoweth what ye utter in its regard! Witness enough is He between me and you! And He is the Gracious, the Merciful
  SAY: I am no apostle of new doctrines: neither know I what will be done with me or you
 Only what is revealed to me do I follow, and I am only charged to warn openly
  SAY: What think ye? If this Book be from God, and ye believe it not, and a witness of the children of Israel3 witness to its conformity with the Law, and believe, while ye proudly disdain it 
 
 
 ? Ah! God guideth not the people guilty of such a wrong!  But the infidels say of the believers, "If it were a good Book they would not have been before us in believing it:"4 And not having submitted to guidance, they proceed to say, "It is an old lying legend!"  But before the Koran was the Book of Moses, a rule and a mercy; and this Book confirmeth it (the Pentateuch)-in the Arabic tongue-that those who are guilty of that wrong may be warned, and as glad tidings to the doers of good
  Assuredly they who say, "Our Lord is God," and take the straight way to Him- no fear shall come on them, neither shall they be put to grief:  These shall be the inmates of Paradise to remain therein for ever,-the recompense of their deeds!  Moreover, we have enjoined on man to shew kindness to his parents
 With pain his mother beareth him; with pain she bringeth him forth: and his bearing and his weaning is thirty months; until when he attaineth his strength, and attaineth to forty years,5 he saith, "O my Lord! stir me up to be grateful for thy favours wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do good works which shall please thee: and prosper me in my offspring: for to thee am I turned, and am resigned to thy will" (am a Muslim)
  These are they from whom we will accept their best works, and whose evil works we will pass by; among the inmates shall they be of Paradise:-a true promise which they are promised
  But he who saith to his parents, "Fie on you both! Promise ye me that I shall be taken forth from the grave alive, when whole generations have already passed away before me?" But they both will implore the help of God, and say, "Alas for thee! Believe: for the promise of God is true
" But he saith, "It is no more than a fable of the ancients
"  These are they in whom the sentence passed on the nations, djinn and men, who flourished before them, is made good
 They shall surely perish
6  And there are grades for all, according to their works, that God may repay them for their works; and they shall not be dealt with unfairly
  And they who believe not shall one day be set before the fire
 "Ye made away your precious gifts during your life on earth; and ye took your fill of pleasure in them: This day, therefore, with punishment of shame shall ye be rewarded, for that ye behaved you proudly and unjustly on the earth, and for that ye were given to excesses
"  Remember, too, the brother of Ad7 when he warned his people in AL AHKAF8-and before and since his time there have been warners-"Worship none but God: verily I fear for you the punishment of the great day
"  They said, "Art thou come to us to turn us away from our Gods? Bring on us now the woes which thou threatenest if thou speakest truth
"  "That knowledge," said he, "is with God alone: I only proclaim to you the message with which I am sent
 But I perceive that ye are a people sunk in ignorance
"  So when they saw a cloud coming straight for their valleys, they said, "It is a passing cloud that shall give us rain
" "Nay, it is that whose speedy coming ye challenged a blast wherein is an afflictive punishment:-  It will destroy everything at the bidding of its Lord!" And at morn nought was to be seen but their empty dwellings! Thus repay we a wicked people
  With power had we endued them, even as with power have we endued you; and we had given them ears and eyes and hearts: yet neither their eyes, nor their ears, nor their hearts aided them at all, when once they gainsaid the signs of God; but that punishment which they had mocked at enveloped them on all sides
  Of old, too, did we destroy the cities which were round about you; and, in order that they might return to us, we varied our signs before them
  But did those whom they took for gods beside God as his kindred deities, help them?9 Nay, they withdrew from them
 Such was their delusion, and their device!  And remember when we turned aside a company of the djinn to thee, that they might hearken to the Koran: and no sooner were they present at its reading than they said to each other, "Hist;" and when it was ended, they returned to their people with warnings
  They said, "O our people! verily we have been listening to a book sent down since the days of Moses, affirming the previous scriptures; it guideth to the truth, and to the right way
  O our people! Obey the Summoner of God, and believe in him, that He may forgive your sins, and rescue you from an afflictive punishment
  And he who shall not respond to God's preacher, yet cannot weaken God's power on earth, nor shall he have protectors beside Him
 These are in obvious error
"  See they not that God who created the Heavens and the Earth, and was not wearied with their creation, is of power to quicken the dead? Yea, he is for all things Potent
  And a day is coming when the infidels shall be set before the fire
 "Is not this it in truth?" They shall say, "Aye, by our Lord
" He said, "Taste then the punishment for that ye would not believe
"  Bear thou up, then, with patience, as did the Apostles endued with firmness, and seek not to accelerate their doom
 For, on the day when they shall see that with which they have been menaced,  It shall be as though they had waited but an hour of the day
 Enough! shall any perish save they who transgress?   _______________________  1 See Sura lxviii

-165 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  PRAISE be to God, who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, and ordained the darkness and the light! Yet unto their Lord do the infidels give peers!  He it is who created you of clay then decreed the term of your life: and with Him is another prefixed term for the resurrection
 Yet have ye doubts thereof!  And He is God in the Heavens and on the Earth! He knoweth your secrets and your disclosures! and He knoweth what ye deserve
  Never did one single sign from among the signs of their Lord come to them, but they turned away from it;  And now, after it hath reached them, have they treated the truth itself as a lie
 But in the end, a message as to that which they have mocked, shall reach them
  See they not how many generations we have destroyed before them? We had settled them on the earth as we have not settled you, and we sent down the very heavens upon them in copious rains, and we made the rivers to flow beneath their feet: yet we destroyed them in their sins, and raised up other generations to succeed them
  And had we sent down to thee a Book written on parchment, and they had touched it with their hands, the infidels had surely said, "This is nought but plain sorcery
"  They say, too, "Unless an angel be sent down to him
 
 
 
" But if we had sent down an angel, their judgment would have come on them at once,1 and they would have had no respite:  And if we had appointed an angel, we should certainly have appointed one in the form of a man, and we should have clothed him before them in garments like their own
2  Moreover, apostles before thee have been laughed to scorn: but that which they laughed to scorn encompassed the mockers among them!  SAY: Go through the land: then see what hath been the end of those who treated them as liars
  SAY: Whose is all that is in the Heavens and the Earth?  SAY: God's
 He had imposed mercy on Himself as a law
 He will surely assemble you on the Resurrection day; there is no doubt of it
 They who are the authors of their own ruin, are they who will not believe
  His, whatsoever hath its dwelling in the night and in the day! and He, the Hearing, the Knowing!  SAY: Other than God shall I take as Lord, maker of the Heavens and of the Earth, who nourisheth all, and of none is nourished? SAY: Verily, I am bidden to be the first of those who surrender them to God (profess Islam): and, be not thou of those who join gods with God
  SAY: Verily, I fear, should I rebel against my Lord, the punishment of the great day
  From whomsoever it shall be averted on that day, He will have had mercy on him: and this will be the manifest bliss
  If God touch thee with trouble, none can take it off but He: and if He visit thee with good-it is He whose power is over all things;  And He is the Supreme over his servants; and He is the Wise, the Cognisant!  SAY: What thing is weightiest in bearing witness? SAY: God is witness between me and you; and this Koran hath been revealed to me that I should warn you by it, and all whom it shall reach
 What! will ye really bear witness that there are other gods with God? SAY: I bear no such witness
 SAY: Verily, He is one God, and truly am guiltless of what ye join with Him
  They to whom we have given the Book, recognise him (Muhammad) as they do their own children:3 but they who are the authors of their own perdition are they who will not believe
  And who more wicked than he who inventeth a lie concerning God, or who treateth our signs as lies? Verily those wicked ones shall not prosper
4  And on "the Day" we will gather them all together: then will we say to those who joined gods with God, "Where are those companion-gods of yours, as ye supposed them?"  Then shall they find no other excuse than to say, "By God our Lord! we joined not companions with Him
"  Behold! how they lie against themselves-and the gods of their own inventing desert them!  Some among them hearken unto thee: but we have cast veils over their hearts that they should not understand the Koran, and a weight into their ears: and though they should see all kinds of signs, they will refuse all faith in them, until when they come to thee, to dispute with thee, the infidels say, "Verily, this is nothing but fables of the ancients
"  And they will forbid it, and depart from it:-but they are only the authors of their own perdition, and know it not
  If thou couldst see when they shall be set over the fire, and shall say, "Oh! would we might be sent back! we would not treat the signs of our Lord as lies! we would be of the believers
"  Aye! that hath become clear5 to them which they before concealed; but though they should return, they would surely go back to that which was forbidden them; for they are surely liars!  And they say, "There is no other than our life in this world, neither shall we be raised again
"  But if thou couldest see when they shall be set before their Lord! He shall say to them, "Is not this it6 in truth?" They shall say, "Yea, by our Lord!" "Taste then," saith He, "the torment, for that ye believed not!"  Lost are they who deny the meeting with God until "the Hour" cometh suddenly upon them! Then will they say, "Oh, our sighs for past negligence of this hour!" and they shall bear their burdens on their back! Will not that be evil with which they shall be burdened?  The life in this world is but a play and pastime; and better surely for men of godly fear will be the future mansion! Will ye not then comprehend?  Now know we that what they speak vexeth thee:7 But it is not merely thee whom they charge with falsehood, but the ungodly gainsay the signs of God
  Before thee have apostles already been charged with falsehood: but they bore the charge and the wrong with constancy, till our help came to them;-for none can change the words of God
 But this history of His Sent Ones hath already reached thee
  But if their estrangement be grievous to thee, and if thou art able to seek out an opening into the earth or a ladder into Heaven,8 that thou mightest bring them a sign
 
 
 
  Yes! But if God pleased, He would surely bring them, one and all, to the guidance! therefore be not thou one of the ignorant
  To those only who shall lend an ear will He make answer: as for the dead, God will raise them up; then unto Him shall they return
  They say, "Unless a sign be sent down to him from his Lord
 
 
 
"  SAY: Verily, God is able to send down a sign; but the greater part of them know it not
  No kind of beast is there on earth nor fowl that flieth with its wings, but is a folk9 like you: nothing have we passed over in the Book:10 then unto their Lord shall they be gathered
  They who gainsay our signs are deaf, and dumb, in darkness: God will mislead whom He pleaseth, and whom He pleaseth He will place upon the straight path
  SAY: What think ye? If the punishment of God were to come upon you, or "the Hour" were to come upon you, will ye cry to any other than God? Tell me, if ye speak the truth?  Yes! to Him will ye cry: and if He please He will deliver you from that ye shall cry to Him to avert, and ye shall forget the partners ye joined with Him
  Already have we sent apostles to nations that were before thee, and we laid hold on them with troubles and with straits in order that they might humble themselves:  Yet, when our trouble came upon them, they did not humble themselves; but their hearts were hardened, and Satan pre-arranged for them11 their course of conduct
  And when they had forgotten their warnings, we set open to them the gates of all things, until, as they were rejoicing in our gifts, we suddenly laid hold upon them, and lo! they were plunged into despair,  And the uttermost part of that impious people was cut off
 All praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds!  SAY: What think ye? If God should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, what god beside God would restore them to you? See! how we vary our wondrous verses (signs)! yet they turn away from them!  SAY: What think ye? If the punishment of God come on you suddenly or foreseen,12 shall any perish except the impious?  We send not our Sent Ones but as heralds of good news and warners; and whoso shall believe and amend, on them shall come no fear, neither shall they be sorrowful:  But whoso shall charge our signs with falsehood, on them shall fall a punishment for their wicked doings
  SAY: I say not to you, "In my possession are the treasures of God;" neither say I, "I know things secret;" neither do I say to you, "Verily, I am an angel:" Only what is revealed to me do I follow
 SAY: Shall the blind and the seeing be esteemed alike? Will ye not then reflect?  And warn those who dread their being gathered to their Lord, that patron or intercessor they shall have none but Him,-to the intent that they may fear Him!  And thrust not thou away those who cry to their Lord at morn and even, craving to behold his face
 It is not for thee in anything to judge of their motives, nor for them in anything to judge of thee
 If thou thrust them away thou wilt be of the doers of wrong
  Thus have we made proof of some of them by others, that they may say, "Are these they among us to whom God hath been gracious?" Doth not God best know the thankful?  And when they who believe in our signs come to thee, SAY: Peace be upon you! Your Lord hath laid down for himself a law of mercy; so that if any one of you commit a fault through ignorance, and afterwards turn and amend, He surely will be Gracious, Merciful
  Thus have we distinctly set forth our signs, that the way of the wicked might be made known
  SAY: Forbidden am I to worship those whom ye call on beside God
 SAY: I will not follow your wishes; for then should I have gone astray, and should not be of the guided
  SAY: I act upon proofs from my Lord, but ye treat them as falsehoods
 That punishment which ye desire to be hastened is not in my power; judgment is with God only: He will declare the truth; and He is the best settler of disputes
  SAY: If what ye would hasten on, were in my power, the matter between me and you had been decided: but God best knoweth the impious
  And with Him are the keys13 of the secret things; none knoweth them but He: He knoweth whatever is on the land and in the sea; and no leaf falleth but He knoweth it; neither is there a grain in the darknesses of the earth, nor a thing green or sere, but it is noted in a distinct writing
14  It is He who taketh your souls at night,15 and knoweth what ye have merited in the day: then he awaketh you therein, that the set life-term may be fulfilled: then unto Him shall ye return; and then shall be declare to you that which ye have wrought
  Supreme over his servants, He sendeth forth guardians who watch over you, until, when death overtaketh any one of you, our messengers take his soul, and fail not:  Then are they returned to God their Lord, the True
 Is not judgment His? Swiftest He, of those who take account!  SAY: Who rescueth you from the darkness of the land and of the sea, when humbly and secretly ye cry to Him-"If thou rescue us from this, we will surely be of the thankful?"  SAY: God rescueth you from them, and from every strait: yet afterwards ye give Him companions!  SAY: It is He who hath power to send on you a punishment from above you, or from beneath your feet, or to clothe you with discord,16 and to make some of you to taste the violence of others
 See how variously we handle the wondrous verses, that haply they may become wise!  But thy people hath accused the Koran of falsehood, though it be the truth: SAY: I am not in charge of you: To every prophecy is its set time, and bye- and-bye ye shall know it!  And when thou seest those who busy themselves with cavilling at our signs, withdraw from them till they busy themselves in some other subject: and if Satan cause thee to forget this, sit not, after recollection, with the ungodly people:17  Not that they who fear God are to pass any judgment upon them, but the object of recollection is that they may continue to fear Him
  And quit those who make their religion a sport and a pastime, and whom this present life hath deceived: warn them hereby that every soul will be consigned to doom for its own works: patron or intercessor, beside God, shall it have none: and could it compensate with fullest compensation, it would not be accepted from it
 They who for their deeds shall be consigned to doom-for them are draughts of boiling water, and a grievous torment; for that they believed not!  SAY: Shall we, beside God, call upon those who can neither help nor hurt us? Shall we turn upon our heel after that God hath guided us? Like some bewildered man whom the Satans have spell-bound in the desert, though his companions call him to the true guidance, with, "Come to us!" SAY: Verily, guidance from God, that is the true guidance; and we are commanded to surrender ourselves to the Lord of the Worlds
  And observe ye the times of prayer, and fear ye God: for it is He to whom ye shall be gathered
  And it is He who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, in truth, and when He saith to a thing, "Be," it is
  His word is the truth: and His the kingdom, on the day when there shall be a blast on the trumpet: He knoweth alike the unseen and the seen: and He is the Wise, the Cognisant
  And remember when Abraham said to his father Azar,18 Takest thou images as gods? Verily, I see that thou and thy people are in manifest error
  And thus did we shew Abraham the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth,19 that he might be stablished in knowledge
  And when the night overshadowed him, he beheld a star
 "This," said he, "is my Lord:" but when it set, he said, "I love not gods which set
"  And when he beheld the moon uprising, "This," said he, "is my Lord:" but when it set, he said, "Surely, if my Lord guide me not, I shall surely be of those who go astray
"  And when he beheld the sun uprise, he said, "This is my Lord; this is greatest
" But when it set, he said, "O my people! I share not with you the guilt of joining gods with God;  I turn my face to him who hath created the Heavens and the Earth, following the right religion:20 I am not one of those who add gods to God
"  And his people disputed with him
-He said: "Dispute ye with me about God, when He hath guided me? And I fear not the deities whom ye join with Him, for only by the will of my Lord have they any power:21 My Lord embraceth all things in His knowledge
 Will ye not then consider?  And how should I fear what ye have joined with God, since ye fear not for having joined with Him that for which He hath sent you down no warranty? Which, therefore, of the two parties is more worthy of safety? Know ye that?  They who believe, and who clothe not their faith with error
22 theirs is safety, and they are guided aright
"  This is our reasoning with which we furnished Abraham against his people: We uplift to grades of wisdom whom we will; Verily thy Lord is Wise, Knowing
  And we gave him Isaac and Jacob, and guided both aright; and we had before guided Noah; and among the descendants of Abraham, David and Solomon, and Job and Joseph, and Moses and Aaron: Thus do we recompense the righteous:  And Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias: all were just persons:  And Ismael and Elisha and Jonas and Lot: all these have we favoured above mankind:  And some of their fathers, and of their offspring, and of their brethren: and we chose them, and guided them into the straight way
  This is God's guidance: He guideth by it such of his servants as he will: But if they join others god with Him, vain assuredly shall be all their works
  These are they to whom we gave the Scripture and Wisdom and Prophecy: but if these their posterity believe not therein, we will entrust these gifts to a people who will not disbelieve therein
  These are they whom God hath guided: follow therefore their guidance
 SAY: No pay do I ask of you for this:23 Verily it is no other than the teaching for all creatures
  No just estimate do they form of God when they say, "Nothing hath God sent down to man
" SAY: Who sent down the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance to man, which ye set down on paper, publishing part, but concealing most: though ye have now been taught that which neither ye nor your fathers knew? SAY: It is God: then leave them in their pastime of cavillings
24  And this Book which we have sent down is blessed, confirming that which was before it; and in order that thou mightest warn the mother-city and those who dwell round about it
 They who believe in the next life will believe in It, and will keep strictly to their Prayers
  But is any more wicked than he who deviseth a lie of God, or saith, "I have had a revelation," when nothing was revealed to him?25 And who saith, "I can bring down a book like that which God hath sent down"? But couldst thou see when the ungodly are in the floods of death, and the angels reach forth their hands, saying, "Yield up your souls:-this day shall ye be recompensed with a humiliating punishment for your untrue sayings about God, and for proudly rejecting his signs!"  "And now are ye come back to us, alone, as we created you at first, and ye leave behind you the good things which we had given you, and we see not with you your intercessors whom ye regarded as the companions of God among you
 There is a severance between you now, and those whom ye regarded as partners with God have deserted you
"  Verily God causeth the grain and the date stone to put forth: He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living! This is God! Why, then, are ye turned aside from Him?  He causeth the dawn to appear, and hath ordained the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for computing time! The ordinance of the Mighty, the Wise!  And it is He who hath ordained the stars for you that ye may be guided thereby in the darknesses of the land and of the sea! clear have we made our signs to men of knowledge
  And it is He who hath produced you from one man, and hath provided for you an abode and resting-place!26 Clear have we made our signs for men of insight
  And it is He who sendeth down rain from Heaven: and we bring forth by it the buds of all the plants, and from them bring we forth the green foliage, and the close growing grain, and palm trees with sheaths of clustering dates, and gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate, like and unlike
27 Look ye on their fruits when they fruit and ripen
 Truly herein are signs unto people who believe
  Yet have they assigned the Djinn to God as his associates, though He created them; and in their ignorance have they falsely ascribed to him sons and daughters
 Glory be to Him! And high let Him be exalted above that which they attribute to Him!  Sole maker of the Heavens and of the Earth! how, when He hath no consort, should He have a son? He hath created everything, and He knoweth everything!  This is God your Lord
 There is no God but He, the creator of all things: therefore worship Him alone;-and He watcheth over all things
  No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision:28 and He is the Subtile, the All-informed
  Now have proofs that may be seen, come to you from your Lord; whoso seeth them, the advantage will be his own: and whoso is blind to them, his own will be the loss: I am not made a keeper over you
  Thus variously do we apply our signs,29 that they may say, "Thou hast studied deep:" and that to people of understanding we may make them clear
  Follow thou that which hath been revealed to thee by thy Lord: there is no god but He! and withdraw from those who join other gods with Him
  Had God pleased, they had not joined other gods with Him: and we have not made thee keeper over them, neither art thou a guardian over them
  Revile not those whom they call on beside God,30 lest they, in their ignorance, despitefully revile Him
 Thus have we planned out their actions for every people; then shall they return to their Lord, and He will declare to them what those actions have been
  With their most solemn oath have they sworn by God, that if a sign come unto them they will certainly believe it; SAY: Signs are in the power of God alone; and He teacheth you not thereby, only because when they were wrought, ye did not believe
31  And we will turn their hearts and their eyes away from the truth, because they did not believe therein at first, and we will leave them in their transgressions, wandering in perplexity
  And though we had sent down the angels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and we had gathered all things about them in tribes, they had not believed, unless God had willed it! but most of them do not know it
  Thus have we given an enemy to every prophet Satans among men and among Djinn: tinsel discourses do they suggest the one to the other, in order to deceive: and had thy Lord willed it, they would not have done it
 Therefore, leave them and their vain imaginings-  And let the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come incline thereto, and let them find their content in this, and let them gain what they are gaining
  What! shall I seek other judge than God, when it is He who hath sent down to you the distinguishing Book? They to whom we have given the Book know that it is sent down from thy Lord with truth
 Be not thou then of those who doubt
  And the words of thy Lord are perfect in truth and in justice: none can change his words: He is the Hearing, Knowing
  But if thou obey most men in this land, from the path of God will they mislead thee: they follow but a conceit, and they are only liars
  Thy Lord! He best knoweth those who err from his path, and He knoweth the rightly guided
  Eat32 of that over which the name of God hath been pronounced, if ye believe in his signs
  And why eat ye not of that over which the name of God hath been pronounced, since He hath made plain to you what He hath forbidden you, save as to that which is forced upon you? But indeed many mislead others by their appetites, through lack of knowledge
 Verily, thy Lord! He best knoweth the transgressors
  And abandon the semblance of wickedness, and wickedness itself
33 They, verily, whose only acquirement is iniquity, shall be rewarded for what they shall have gained
  Eat not therefore of that on which the name of God has not been named, for that is assuredly a crime: the Satans will indeed suggest to their votaries to wrangle with you; but if ye obey them, ye will indeed be of those who join gods with God
  Shall the dead, whom we have quickened, and for whom we have ordained a light whereby he may walk among men, be like him, whose likeness is in the darkness, whence he will not come forth? Thus have the doings of the unbelievers been prepared for them
  Even so have we placed in every city, ringleaders of its wicked ones, to scheme therein: but only against themselves shall they scheme! and they know it not
  And when a sign cometh to them they say, "We will not believe, till the like of what was accorded to the apostles of God, be accorded to us
" God best knoweth where to place his mission
 Disgrace with God, and a vehement punishment shall come on the transgressors for their crafty plottings
  And whom God shall please to guide, that man's breast will He open to Islam; but whom He shall please to mislead, strait and narrow will He make his breast, as though he were mounting up into the very Heavens! Thus doth God inflict dire punishment on those who believe not
  And this is the right way of thy Lord
 Now have we detailed our signs unto those who will consider
  For them is a dwelling of peace with their Lord! and in recompense for their works, shall he be their protector
  On the day whereon God shall gather them all together 
 
 
  "O race of Djinn," will He say, "much did ye exact from mankind
" And their votaries from among men shall say, "O our Lord! we rendered one another mutual services: but we have reached our set term, which thou hast set for us
" He will say, "Your abode the fire! therein abide ye for ever: unless as God shall will
" Verily, thy Lord is Wise, Knowing
  Even thus place we some of the wicked over others, as the meed of their doings
  O race of Djinn and men! came not apostles to you from among yourselves, rehearsing my signs to you, and warning you of the meeting of this your day? They shall say, "We bear witness against ourselves
" This world's life deceived them; and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were infidels:-  This,34 because thy Lord would not destroy the cities in their sin, while their people were yet careless
  And for all, are grades of recompense as the result of their deeds; and of what they do, thy Lord is not regardless
  And thy Lord is the Rich one, full of compassion! He can destroy you if He please, and cause whom He will to succeed you, as he raised you up from the offspring of other people:  Verily, that which is threatened you shall surely come to pass, neither shall ye weaken its might
  SAY: O my people! Act as ye best can: I verily will act my part, and hereafter shall ye know  Whose will be the recompense of the abode! Verily, the ungodly shall not prosper
  Moreover, they set apart a portion of the fruits and cattle35 which he hath produced, and say, "This for God"-so deem they-"And this for his companions, whom we associate with Him
" But that which is for these companions of theirs, cometh not to God; yet that which is for God, cometh to the companions! Ill do they judge
  Thus have the companion-gods induced many of these, who join them with God, to slay their children, that they might ruin them, and throw the cloak of confusion over their religion
 But if God had pleased, they had not done this
 Therefore, leave them and their devices
  They also say, "These cattle and fruits are sacred: none may taste them but whom we please:" so deem they-"And there are cattle, whose backs should be exempt from labour
" And there are cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of God: inventing in all this a lie against Him
 For their inventions shall He reward them
  And they say, "That which is in the wombs of these cattle is allowed to our males, and forbidden to our wives;" but if it prove abortive, both partake of it
 God shall reward them for their distinctions! Knowing, Wise is He
  Lost are they who, in their ignorance, have foolishly slain their children, and have forbidden that which God hath given them for food, devising an untruth against God! Now have they erred; and they were not rightly guided
  He it is who produceth gardens of the vine trellised and untrellised, and the palm trees, and the corn of various food, and olives, and pomegranates, like and unlike
 Eat of their fruit when they bear fruit, and pay the due thereof on the day of its ingathering: and be not prodigal, for God loveth not the prodigal
  And there are cattle for burdens and for journeys
 Eat of what God hath given you for food; and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your declared enemy
  You have four sorts of cattle in pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair
 SAY: Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge, if ye speak the truth:  And of camels a pair, and of oxen a pair
 SAY: Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females enclose?36 Were ye witnesses when God enjoined you this? Who then is more wicked than he who, in his ignorance, inventeth a lie against God, to mislead men? God truly guideth not the wicked
  SAY: I find not in what hath been revealed to me aught forbidden to the eater to eat, except it be that which dieth of itself, or blood poured forth, or swine's flesh; for this is unclean or profane, being slain in the name of other than God
 But whoso shall be a forced partaker, if it be without wilfulness, and not in transgression,-verily, thy Lord is Indulgent, Merciful!  To the Jews did we forbid every beast having an entire hoof, and of both bullocks and sheep we forbade them the fat, save what might be on their backs, or their entrails, and the fat attached to the bone
 With this have we recompensed them, because of their transgression: and verily, we are indeed equitable
  If they treat thee as an impostor, then SAY: Your Lord is of all-embracing mercy: but his severity shall not be turned aside from the wicked
  They who add gods to God will say, "If God had pleased, neither we nor our fathers had given him companions, nor should we have interdicted anything
" Thus did they who flourished before them charge with imposture, until they had tasted our severity! SAY: Have ye any knowledge that ye can produce to us? Verily, ye follow only a conceit: ye utter only lies!  SAY: Peremptory proof is God's! Had He pleased He had guided you all aright
  SAY: Bring hither your witnesses who can witness that God hath forbidden these animals; but if they bear witness, witness not thou with them, nor witness to the conceits of those who charge our signs with falsehood, and who believe not in the life to come, and give equals to our Lord
  SAY: Come, I will rehearse what your Lord hath made binding on you-that ye assign not aught to Him as partner; and that ye be good to your parents; and that ye slay not your children, because of poverty: for them and for you will we provide:37 and that ye come not near to pollutions, outward or inward:38 and that ye slay not anyone whom God hath forbidden you, unless for a just cause
 This hath he enjoined on you, to the intent that ye may understand
  And come not nigh to the substance of the orphan, but to improve it, until he come of age: and use a full measure, and a just balance: We will not task a soul beyond its ability
 And when ye give judgment, observe justice, even though it be the affair of a kinsman, and fulfil the covenant of God
 This hath God enjoined you for your monition-  And, "this is my right way
" Follow it then; and follow not other paths lest ye be scattered from His path
 This hath he enjoined you, that ye may fear Him
  Then39 gave we the Book to Moses-complete for him who should do right, and a decision for all matters, and a guidance, and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord
  Blessed, too, this Book which we have sent down
 Wherefore follow it and fear God, that ye may find mercy:  Lest ye should say, "The Scriptures were indeed sent down only unto two peoples before us, but we were not able to go deep into their studies:"40  Or lest ye should say, "If a book had been sent down to us, we had surely followed the guidance better than they
" But now hath a clear exposition come to you from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy
 Who then is more wicked than he who treateth the signs of God as lies, and turneth aside from them? We will recompense those who turn aside from our signs with an evil punishment, because they have turned aside
  What wait they for, but the coming of the angels to them, or the coming of thy Lord Himself, or that some of the sings of the Lord should come to pass? On the day when some of thy Lord's signs shall come to pass, its faith shall not profit a soul which believed not before, nor wrought good works in virtue of its faith
 SAY: Wait ye
 Verily, we will wait also
  As to those who split up their religion and become sects, have thou nothing to do with them: their affair is with God only
 Hereafter shall he tell them what they have done
  He who shall present himself with good works shall receive a tenfold reward; but he who shall present himself with evil works shall receive none other than a like punishment: and they shall not be treated unjustly
  SAY: As for me, my Lord hath guided me into a straight path; a true religion, the creed of Abraham, the sound in faith; for he was not of those who join gods with God
  SAY: My prayers and my worship and my life and my death are unto God, Lord of the Worlds
 He hath no associate
 This am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims
  SAY: Shall I seek any other Lord than God, when He is Lord of all things? No soul shall labour but for itself; and no burdened one shall bear another's burden
 At last ye shall return to your Lord, and he will declare that to you about which you differ
  And it is He who hath made you the successors of others on the earth, and hath raised some of you above others by various grades, that he may prove you by his gifts
 Verily thy Lord is swift to punish
 But He is also Gracious, Merciful!   _______________________  1 Lit

1 These, the signs of the Book! And that which hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord is the very truth: But the greater part of men will not believe
  It is God who hath reared the Heavens without pillars thou canst behold; then mounted his throne, and imposed laws on the sun and moon: each travelleth to its appointed goal
 He ordereth all things
 He maketh his signs clear, that ye may have firm faith in a meeting with your Lord
  And He it is who hath outstretched the earth, and placed on it the firm mountains, and rivers: and of every fruit He hath placed on it two kinds: He causeth the night to enshroud the day
 Verily in this are signs for those who reflect
  And on the earth hard by each other are its various portions: gardens of grapes and corn, and palm trees single or clustered
 Though watered by the same water, yet some make we more excellent as food than other: Verily in all this are signs for those who understand
  If ever thou dost marvel, marvellous surely is their saying, "What! when we have become dust, shall we be restored in a new creation?"  These are they who in their Lord believe not: these! the collars shall be on their necks; and these shall be inmates of the fire, to abide therein for aye
  To hasten evil rather than good will they challenge thee: but, before their time have been like examples
 Full, truly, of mercy is thy Lord unto men, despite their sins; but verily, thy Lord is right vehement to punish
  And they who believe not say: "If a sign from his Lord be not sent down to him 
 
 
 !" Thou art a warner only
 And every people hath its guide
  God knoweth the burden of every female, and how much their wombs lessen and enlarge: with Him everything is by measure:  Knower of the Hidden and the Manifest! the Great! the Most High!  Alike to Him is that person among you who concealeth his words, and he that telleth them abroad: he who hideth him in the night, and he who cometh forth in the day
  Each hath a succession of Angels before him and behind him, who watch over him by God's behest
 Verily, God will not change his gifts to men, till they change what is in themselves: and when God willeth evil unto men, there is none can turn it away, nor have they any protector beside Him
  He it is who maketh the lightning to shine unto you; for fear and hope: and who bringeth up the laden clouds
  And the THUNDER uttereth his praise, and the Angels also, for awe of Him: and he sendeth his bolts and smiteth with them whom he will2 while they are wrangling about God! Mighty is he in prowess
  Prayer is His of right: but these deities to whom they pray beside Him give them no answer, otherwise than as he is answered who stretcheth forth his hands to the water that it may reach his mouth, when it cannot reach it! The prayer of the Infidels only wandereth, and is lost
  And unto God doth all in the Heavens and on the Earth bow down in worship, willingly or by constraint: their very shadows also morn and even!  SAY: Who is Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth? SAY: God
 SAY: Why then have ye taken beside Him protectors, who even for their own selves have no power for help or harm? SAY: What! shall the blind and the seeing be held equal? Shall the darkness and the light be held equal? Or have they given associates to God who have created as He hath created, so that their creation appear to them like His? SAY: God is the Creator of all things! He is the One! the Conquering!  He sendeth down the rain from Heaven: then flow the torrents in their due measure, and the flood beareth along a swelling foam
 And from the metals which are molten in the fire for the sake of ornaments or utensils, a like scum ariseth
 In this way doth God depict (set forth) truth and falsehood
 As to the foam, it is quickly gone: and as to what is useful to man, it remaineth on the earth
 Thus doth God set forth comparisons! To those who respond to their Lord shall be an excellent reward; but those who respond not to his call, had they all that the earth containeth twice over, they would surely give it for their ransom
 Evil their reckoning! and Hell their home! And wretched the bed!  Shall he then who knoweth that what hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord is the truth, act like him who is blind? Men of insight only will bear this in mind,  Who fulfil their pledge to God, and break not their compact:  And who join together what God hath bidden to be joined, and who fear their Lord, and dread an ill reckoning;  And who, from desire to see the face of their Lord, are constant amid trials, and observe prayer and give alms, in secret and openly, out of what we have bestowed upon them, and turn aside evil by good: for these is the recompense of that abode,  Gardens of Eden-into which they shall enter together with the just of their fathers, and their wives, and their descendants: and the angels shall go in unto them at every portal:  "Peace be with you!" say they, "because ye have endured all things!" Charming the recompense of their abode!  But those who, after having contracted it, break their covenant with God, and cut asunder what God hath bidden to be united, and commit misdeeds on the earth, these, a curse awaiteth them, and an ill abode!  God is open-handed with supplies to whom he will, or is sparing
 They rejoice in the life that now is, but this present life is but a passing good, in respect of the life to come!3  And they who believe not say, "Unless a sign be sent down to him from his Lord
 
 
 
" SAY: God truly will mislead whom he will; and He will guide to Himself him who turneth to Him,  Those who believe, and whose hearts rest securely on the thought of God
 What! Shall not men's hearts repose in the thought of God? They who believe and do the things that be right-blessedness awaiteth them, and a goodly home
  Thus have we sent thee to a people whom other peoples have preceded, that thou mightest rehearse to them our revelations to thee
 Yet they believe not on the God of Mercy
4 SAY: He is my Lord
 There is no God but He
 In Him do I put my trust
 To Him must I return
  If there were a Koran by which the mountains could be set in motion, or the earth cleft, or the dead be made to speak  ! But all sovereignty is in the hands of God
 Do then believers doubt5 that had He pleased God would certainly have guided all men aright?  Misfortune shall not cease to light on the unbelievers for what they have done, or to take up its abode hard by their dwellings, until the threat of God come to pass
 Verily, God will not fail his plighted word
  Before thee indeed have apostles been mocked at; but though I bore long with the unbelievers, at last I seized upon them;-and how severe was my punishment!  Who is it then that is standing over every soul to mark its actions? Yet have they set up associates with God
 SAY: Name them
 What! Would ye inform God of that which He knoweth not on the Earth? Or are they not a mere empty name? But prepared of old for the infidels was this fraud of theirs; and they are turned aside from the path; and whom God causeth to err, no guide shall there be for him!  Chastisement awaiteth them in this present life, and more grievous shall be the chastisement of the next: and none shall screen them from God
  A picture of the Paradise which God hath promised to them that fear Him
 The rivers flow beneath its bowers: its food and its shades are perpetual
 This is the reward of those who fear God; but the reward of the unbelievers is the Fire
  They to whom we have given the Book rejoice6 in what hath been sent down to thee; yet some are banded together who deny a part of it
 SAY: I am commanded to worship God, and not to associate any creature with Him
 On Him do I call, and to Him shall I return
  Thus, then, as a code in the Arabic tongue have we sent down the Koran; and truly, if after the knowledge that hath reached thee thou follow their desires, thou shalt have no guardian nor protector against God
  Apostles truly have we already sent before thee, and wives and offspring have we given them
 Yet no apostle had come with miracles unless by the leave of God
 To each age its Book
  What He pleaseth will God abrogate or confirm: for with Him is the source of revelation
7  Moreover, whether we cause thee to see the fulfilment of part of our menaces, or whether we take thee hence, verily, thy work is preaching only, and ours to take account
  See they not that we come into their land and cut short its borders?8 God pronounceth a doom, and there is none to reverse his doom
 And swift is He to take account
  Those who lived before them made plots: but all plotting is controlled by God: He knoweth the works of every one, and the infidels shall know whose will be the recompense of the abode
  The infidels, moreover, will say; Thou art not sent of God
 SAY: God is witness enough betwixt me and you, and, whoever hath knowledge of the Book

2 No doubt is there about this Book: It is a guidance to the God-fearing,  Who believe in the unseen,3 who observe prayer, and out of what we have bestowed on them, expend for God;  And who believe in what hath been sent down to thee, and in what hath been sent down before thee, and full faith have they in the life to come:  These are guided by their Lord; and with these it shall be well
  As to the infidels, alike is it to them whether thou warn them or warn them not-they will not believe:  Their hearts and their ears hath God sealed up; and over their eyes is a covering
 For them, a severe chastisement!  And some4 there are who say, "We believe in God, and in the latter day:" Yet are they not believers!  Fain would they deceive God and those who have believed; but they deceive themselves only, and know it not
  Diseased are their hearts! And that disease hath God increased creased to them
 Their's a sore chastisement, for that they treated their prophet as a liar!  And when it is said to them, "Cause not disorders in the earth:" they say, "Nay, rather do we set them right
"  Is it not that they are themselves the authors of disorder? But they perceive it not!  And when it is said to them, "Believe as other men have believed;" they say, "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?" Is it not that they are themselves the fools? But they know it not!  And when they meet the faithful they say, "We believe;" but when they are apart with their Satans5 they say, "Verily we hold with you, and at them we only mock
"  God shall mock at them, and keep them long in their rebellion, wandering in perplexity
  These are they who have purchased error at the price of guidance: but their traffic hath not been gainful, neither are they guided at all
  They are like one6 who kindleth a fire, and when it hath thrown its light on all around him
 
 
 
  God taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness-they cannot see!-  Deaf, dumb, blind: therefore they shall not retrace their steps from error!  Or like those who, when there cometh a storm-cloud out of the Heaven, big with darkness thunder and lightning, thrust their fingers into their ears because of the thunder-clap, for fear of death! God is round about the infidels
  The lightning almost snatcheth away their eyes! So oft as it gleameth on them they walk on in it, but when darkness closeth upon them, they stop! And if God pleased, of their ears and of their eyes would he surely deprive them: verily God is Almighty! O men of Mecca7 adore your Lord, who hath created you and those who were before you: haply ye will fear Him  Who hath made the earth a bed for you, and the heaven a covering, and hath caused water to come down from heaven, and by it hath brought forth fruits for your sustenance! Do not then wittingly give peers to God
  And if ye be in doubt as to that which we have sent down to our servant, then produce a Sura like it, and summon your witnesses, beside God, if ye are men of truth:  But if ye do it not, and never shall ye do it, then fear the fire prepared for the infidels, whose fuel is men and stones:8  But announce to those who believe and do the things that are right, that for them are gardens 'neath which the rivers flow! So oft as they are fed therefrom with fruit for sustenance, they shall say, "This same was our sustenance of old:" And they shall have its like given to them
9 Therein shall they have wives of perfect purity, and therein shall they abide for ever
  Verily God is not ashamed to set forth as well the instance of a gnat10 as of any nobler object: for as to those who have believed, they know it to be the truth from their Lord; but as to the unbelievers, they will say, "What meaneth God by this comparison?" Many will He mislead by such parables and many guide: but none will He mislead thereby except the wicked,  Who, after its establishment, violate the covenant of God,11 and cut in sunder what God hath bidden to be joined, and act disorderly on the Earth
 These are they who shall suffer loss!  How can ye withhold faith from God? Ye were dead and He gave you life; next He will cause you to die; next He will restore you to life: next shall ye return to Him!  He it is who created for you all that is on Earth, then proceeded to the Heaven, and into seven12 Heavens did He fashion it: and He knoweth all things
  When thy Lord said to the angels, "Verily, I am about to place one in my stead on earth,"13 they said, "Wilt thou place there one who will do ill therein and shed blood, when we celebrate thy praise and extol thy holiness?" God said, "Verily, I know what ye know not
"  And he taught Adam the names of all things, and then set them before the angels,14 and said, "Tell me the names of these, if ye are endued with wisdom
"15  They said, "Praise be to Thee! We have no knowledge but what Thou hast given us to know
 Thou! Thou art the Knowing, the Wise
"  He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names
" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not say to you that I know the hidden things of the Heavens and of the Earth, and that I know what ye bring to light, and what ye hide?"  And when we said to the angels, "Bow down and worship Adam," then worshipped they all, save Eblis
16 He refused and swelled with pride, and became one of the unbelievers
  And we said, "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye plentifully therefrom wherever ye list; but to this tree come not nigh, lest ye become of the transgressors
"  But Satan17 made them slip from it, and caused their banishment from the place in which they were
 And we said, "Get ye down, the one of you an enemy to the other: and there shall be for you in the earth a dwelling-place, and a provision for a time
"  And words of prayer learned Adam from his Lord: and God turned to him; for He loveth to turn, the Merciful
  We said, "Get ye down from it, all together: and if  Guidance shall come to you from me, whoso shall follow my guidance, on them shall come no fear, neither shall they be grieved:  But they who shall not believe, and treat our signs as false-hoods, these shall be inmates of the fire; in it shall they remain for ever
"  O children of Israel! remember my favour wherewith I shewed favour upon you, and be true to your covenant with me; I will be true to my covenant with you; me therefore, revere me! and believe in what I have sent down confirming your Scriptures, and be not the first to disbelieve it, neither for a mean price barter my signs: me therefore, fear ye me!  And clothe not the truth with falsehood, and hide not the truth when ye know it:18  And observe prayer and pay the legal impost, and bow down with those who bow
  Will ye enjoin what is right upon others, and forget yourselves? Yet ye read the Book: will ye not understand?  And seek help with patience and prayer: a hard duty indeed is this, but not to the humble,  Who bear in mind that they shall meet their Lord, and that unto Him shall they return
  O children of Israel! remember my favour wherewith I shewed favour upon you; for verily to you above all human beings have I been bounteous
  And fear ye the day when soul shall not satisfy for soul at all, nor shall any intercession be accepted from them, nor shall any ransom be taken, neither shall they be helped
  And remember when we rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who had laid on you a cruel chastisement
 They slew your male children, and let only your females live: and in this was a great trial from your Lord:  And when we parted the sea for you, and saved you, and drowned the people of Pharaoh, while ye were looking on:  And when we were in treaty with Moses forty nights: then during his absence took ye the calf and acted wickedly:  Yet after this we forgave you, that ye might be grateful:  And when we gave Moses the Book and the Illumination19 in order to your guidance:  And remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people! verily ye - have sinned to your own hurt, by your taking the calf to worship it: Be turned then to your creator, and slay the guilty among you;20 this will be best for you with your creator:" Then turned He unto you, for He is the one who turneth, the Merciful:  And when ye said, "O Moses! we will not believe thee until we see God plainly;" the thunderbolt fell upon you while ye were looking on:  Then we raised you to life after ye had been dead,21 that haply ye might give thanks:  And we caused the clouds to overshadow you, and we sent down manna and quails upon you;-"Eat of the good things we have give you for sustenance;"-and they injured not us but they injured themselves
22  And when we said, "Enter this city,23 and eat therefrom plentifully, at your will, and enter the gate with prostrations, and say, 'Forgiveness;' and we will pardon you your sins, and give an increase to the doers of good:"-  But the evil-doers changed that word into another than that spoken to them,24 and we sent down upon those evil-doers wrath from heaven, for that they had done amiss:  And when Moses asked drink for his people, we said, "Strike the rock with thy rod;" and from it there gushed twelve fountains: each tribe25 knew their drinking-place:-"Eat and drink," said we, "of what God hath supplied, and do no wrong on the earth by licentious deeds:"  And when ye said, "O Moses! we will not put up with one sort of food: pray, therefore, thy Lord for us, that He would bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions:" He said, "What! will ye exchange that which is worse for what is better? Get ye down into Egypt;-for ye shall have what ye have asked:" Vileness and poverty were stamped upon them, and they returned with wrath from God: This, for that they disbelieved the signs of God, and slew the Prophets26 unjustly: this, for that they rebelled and transgressed!  Verily, they who believe (Muslims), and they who follow the Jewish religion, and the Christians, and the Sabeites27-whoever of these believeth in God and the last day, and doeth that which is right, shall have their reward with their Lord: fear shall not come upon them, neither shall they be grieved
  Call to mind also when we entered into a covenant with you, and lifted up the mountain28 over you:-"Take hold," said we, "on what we have revealed to you, with resolution, and remember what is therein, that ye may fear:"  But after this ye turned back, and but for God's grace and mercy toward you, ye had surely been of the lost! Ye know too those of you who transgressed on the Sabbath, and to whom we said, "Be changed into scouted apes:"29  And we made them a warning to those of their day, and to those who came after them, and a caution to the God-fearing:  And when Moses said to his people, "Verily, God bids you sacrifice a COW;"30 they said, "Makest thou a jest of us?" He said, "God keep me from being one of the foolish
" They said, "Call on thy Lord for us that He would make plain to us what she is
" He said, "God saith, 'She is a cow neither old nor young, but of the middle age between the two:' do therefore what ye are bidden
"  They said, "Call on your Lord for us, that he would make plain to us what is her colour
" He said, "God saith, 'She is a fawn-coloured cow; her colour is very bright; she rejoiceth the beholders
' "  They said, "Call on they Lord for us that He would make plain to us what cow it is-for to us are cows alike,-and verily, if God please, we shall be guided rightly:"  He said, "God saith, 'She is a cow not worn by ploughing the earth or watering the field, sound, no blemish in her
' " They said, "Now hast thou brought the truth:" Then they sacrificed her; Yet nearly had they done it not:  And when ye slew a man, and strove among yourselves about him, God brought to light what he had hidden:  For we said, "Strike the corpse with part of her
" So God giveth life to the dead, and sheweth you his signs, that haply ye may understand
  Then after that your hearts became hard like rocks, or harder still: for verily, from rocks have rivers gushed; others, verily, have been cleft, and water hath issued from them; and others, verily, have sunk down through fear of God: And God is not regardless of your actions
  Desire ye then that for your sakes31 the Jews should believe? Yet a part of them heard the word of God, and then, after they had understood it, perverted it, and knew that they did so
  And when they fall in with the faithful, they say, "We believe;" but when they are apart32 one with another, they say, "Will ye acquaint them with what God hath revealed to you, that they may dispute with you about it in the presence of your Lord?" Understand ye their aim?  Know they not that God knoweth what they hide, as well as what they bring to light?  But there are illiterates among them who are unacquainted with the Book,33 but with lies only, and have but vague fancies
 Woe to those who with their own hands transcribe the Book corruptly, and then say, "This is from God," that they may sell it for some mean price! Woe then to them for that which their hands have written! and, Woe to them for the gains which they have made!  And they say, "Hell fire shall not touch us, but for a few days:"34 SAY: Have ye received such a promise from God? for God will not revoke his promise: or, Speak ye of God that which ye know not?  But they whose only gains are evil works, and who are environed by their sins,-they shall be inmates of the fire, therein to abide for ever:  But they who have believed and done the things that be right, they shall be the inmates of Paradise,-therein to abide for ever
  And when we entered into covenant with the children of Israel, we said, "Worship none but God, and be good to your parents and kindred, and to orphans, and to the poor, and speak with men what is right, and observe prayer, and pay the stated alms
" Then turned ye away, except a few of you, and withdrew afar off
  And when we made a covenant with you that ye should not shed your own blood,35 nor expel one another from your abodes, then ye ratified it and yourselves were witnesses
  Then were ye the very persons who slew one another; and ye drove out a part of your own people from their abodes; ye lent help against them with wrong and hatred; but if they come captives to you, ye redeem them!-Yet it was forbidden you to drive them out
36 Believe ye then part of the Book, and deny part? But what shall be the meed of him among you who doth this, but shame in this life? And on the day of the Resurrection they shall be sent to the most cruel of torments, for God is not regardless of what ye do
  These are they who purchase this present life at the price of that which is to come: their torment shall not be lightened, neither shall they be helped
  Moreover, to Moses gave we "the Book," and we raised up apostles after him; and to Jesus, son of Mary, gave we clear proofs of his mission, and strengthened him by the Holy Spirit
37 So oft then as an apostle cometh to you with that which your souls desire not, swell ye with pride, and treat some as impostors, and slay others?  And they say, "Uncircumcised are our hearts
" Nay! God hath cursed them in their infidelity: few are they who believe!  And when a Book had come to them from God, confirming that which they had received already-although they had before prayed for victory over those who believed not-yet when that Koran come to them, of which they had knowledge, they did not recognise it
 The curse of God on the infidels!  For a vile price have they sold themselves, by not believing what God hath sent down, envious of God's sending down his grace on such of his servants as he pleaseth:38 and they have brought on themselves wrath upon wrath
 And for the unbelievers is a disgraceful chastisement
  And when it is said to them, "Believe in what God hath sent down," they say, "In that which hath been sent down to us we believe:" but what hath since been sent down they disbelieve, although it be the truth confirmatory of their own Scriptures
 SAY: Why then have ye of old slain God's prophets,39 if ye are indeed believers?  Moreover, Moses came unto you with proofs of his mission
 Then in his absence ye took the calf for your God, and did wickedly
  And when we accepted your covenant, and uplifted40 the mountain over you, we said, "Take firm hold on what we have given you, and hearken
" They said, "We have hearkened and have rebelled:" then were they made to drink down the calf into their hearts for their ingratitude
 SAY: A bad thing hath your faith commanded you, if ye be indeed believers
  SAY: If the future dwelling place with God be specially for you, but not for the rest of mankind, then wish for death, if ye are sincere:  But never can they wish for it, because of that which their own hands have sent on before them!41 And God knoweth the offenders
  And thou wilt surely find them of all men most covetous of life, beyond even the polytheists
 To be kept alive a thousand years might one of them desire: but that he may be preserved alive, shall no one reprieve himself from the punishment! And God seeth what they do
  SAY: Whoso is the enemy of Gabriel-For he it is who by God's leave hath caused the Koran to descend on thy heart, the confirmation of previous revelations, and guidance, and good tidings to the faithful-  Whoso is an enemy to God or his angels, or to Gabriel, or to Michael, shall have God as his enemy: for verily God is an enemy to the Infidels
  Moreover, clear signs have we sent down to thee, and none will disbelieve them but the perverse
  Oft as they have formed an engagement with thee, will some of them set it aside? But most of them believe not
  And when there came to them an apostle from God, affirming the previous revelations made to them, some of those to whom the Scriptures were given, threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they knew it not:  And they followed what the Satans read42 in the reign of Solomon: not that Solomon was unbelieving, but the Satans were unbelieving
 Sorcery did they teach to men, and what had been revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, at Babel
 Yet no man did these two teach until they had said, "We are only a temptation
 Be not then an unbeliever
" From these two did men learn how to cause division between man and wife: but unless by leave of God, no man did they harm thereby
 They learned, indeed, what would harm and not profit them; and yet they knew that he who bought that art should have no part in the life to come! And vile the price for which they have sold themselves,-if they had but known it!  But had they believed and feared God, better surely would have been the reward from God,-if they had but known it!  O ye who believe! say not to our apostle, "Raina"43 (Look at us); but say, "Ondhorna" (Regard us)
 And attend to this; for, the Infidels shall suffer a grievous chastisement
  The unbelievers among the people of the Book, and among the idolaters, desire not that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord: but God will shew His special mercy to whom He will, for He is of great bounty
  Whatever verses we cancel,44 or cause thee to forget, we bring a better or its like
 Knowest thou not that God hath power over all things?  Knowest thou not that the dominion of the Heavens and of the Earth is God's? and that ye have neither patron nor helper, save God?  Would ye ask of your apostle what of old was asked of Moses? But he who exchangeth faith for unbelief,45 hath already erred from the even way
  Many of the people of the Book desire to bring you back to unbelief after ye have believed, out of selfish envy, even after the truth hath been clearly shewn them
 But forgive them, and shun them till God shall come in with His working
 Truly God hath power over all things
  And observe prayer and pay the legal impost:46 and whatever good thing ye have sent on before for your soul's sake, ye shall find it with God
 Verily God seeth what ye do
  And they say, "None but Jews or Christians shall enter Paradise:" This is their wish
 SAY: Give your proofs if ye speak the truth
  But they who set their face with resignation Godward, and do what is right,- their reward is with their Lord; no fear shall come on them, neither shall they be grieved
  Moreover, the Jews say, "The Christians lean on nought:" "On nought lean the Jews," say the Christians: Yet both are readers of the Book
 So with like words say they who have no knowledge
47 But on the resurrection day, God shall judge between them as to that in which they differ
  And who committeth a greater wrong than he who hindereth God's name from being remembered in his temples, and who hasteth to ruin them?48 Such men cannot enter them but with fear
 Their's is shame in this world, and a severe torment in the next
  The East and the West is God's: therefore, whichever way ye turn, there is the face of God:49 Truly God is immense and knoweth all
  And they say, "God hath a son:" No! Praise be to Him!  But-His, whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth! All obeyeth Him,  Sole maker of the Heavens and of the Earth! And when He decreeth a thing, He only saith to it, "Be," and it is
  And they who have no knowledge say, "Unless God speak to us, or thou shew us a sign 
 
 
 !"  So, with like words, said those who were before them: their hearts are alike: Clear signs have we already shewn for those who have firm faith:  Verily, with the Truth have we sent thee, a bearer of good tidings and a warner: and of the people of Hell thou shalt not be questioned
  But until thou follow their religion, neither Jews nor Christians will be satisfied with thee
 SAY: Verily, guidance of God,-that is the guidance! And if, after "the Knowledge" which hath reached thee, thou follow their desires, thou shalt find neither helper nor protector against God
  They to whom we have given the Book, and who read it as it ought to be read,- these believe therein: but whoso believeth not therein, shall meet with perdition
  O children of Israel! remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you, and that high above all mankind have I raised you:  And dread the day when not in aught shall soul satisfy for soul, nor shall any ransom be taken from it, nor shall any intercession avail, and they shall not be helped
  When his Lord made trial of Abraham by commands which he fulfilled, He said, "I am about to make thee an Imâm to mankind:" he said, "Of my offspring also:" "My covenant," said God, "embraceth not the evil doers
"  And remember when we appointed the Holy House50 as man's resort and safe retreat, and said, "Take ye the station of Abraham for a place of prayer:" And we commanded Abraham and Ismael, "Purify my house for those who shall go in procession round it, and those who shall abide there for devotion, and those who shall bow down and prostrate themselves
"  And when Abraham said, "Lord! make this secure land, and supply its people with fruits, such of them as believe in God and in the last day:" He said, "And whoso believeth not, for a little while will I bestow good things on him; then will I drive him to the torment of the Fire!" An ill passage!  And when Abraham, with Ismael, raised the foundations51 of the House, they said, "O our Lord! accept it from us; for thou art the Hearer, the Knower
  O our Lord! make us also Muslims, and our posterity a Muslim people; and teach us our holy rites, and be turned towards us, for thou art He who turneth, the Merciful
  O our Lord! raise up among them an apostle52 who may rehearse thy signs unto them, and teach them 'the Book,' and Wisdom, and purify them: for thou art the Mighty, the Wise
"  And who but he that hath debased his soul to folly will mislike the faith of Abraham, when we have chosen him in this world, and in the world to come he shall be of the Just?  When his Lord said to him, "Resign thyself to me," he said, "I resign myself to the Lord of the Worlds
"  And this to his children did Abraham bequeath, and Jacob also, saying, "O my children! truly God hath chosen a religion for you; so die not unless ye be also Muslims
"  Were ye present when Jacob was at the point of death?53 when he said to his sons, "Whom will ye worship when I am gone?" They said, "We will worship thy God and the God of thy fathers Abraham and Ismael and Isaac, one God, and to Him are we surrendered (Muslims)
"  That people have now passed away; they have the reward of their deeds, and ye shall have the meed of yours: but of their doings ye shall not be questioned
  They say, moreover, "Become Jews or Christians that ye may have the true guidance
" SAY: Nay! the religion of Abraham, the sound in faith,54 and not one of those who join gods with God!  Say ye: "We believe in God, and that which hath been sent down to us, and that which hath been sent down to Abraham and Ismael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes: and that which hath been given to Moses and to Jesus, and that which was given to the prophets from their Lord
 No difference do we make between any of them: and to God are we resigned (Muslims)
"  If therefore they believe even as ye believe, then have they true guidance; but if they turn back, then do they cut themselves off from you: and God will suffice to protect thee against them, for He is the Hearer, the Knower
55  Islam is the Baptism of God,56 and who is better to baptise than God? And Him do we serve
  SAY: Will ye dispute with us about God? when He is our Lord and your Lord! We have our works and ye have your works; and we are sincerely His
  Will ye say, "Verily Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, were Jews or Christians?" SAY: Who knoweth best, ye, or God? And who is more in fault than he who concealeth the witness which he hath from God? But God is not regardless of what ye do
  That people have now passed away: they have the reward of their deeds, and for you is the meed of yours; but of their doings ye shall not be questioned
  The foolish ones will say, "What hath turned them from the kebla which they used?" SAY: The East and the West are God's
 He guideth whom he will into the right path
  Thus have we made you a central people,57 that ye may be witnesses in regard to mankind, and that the apostle may be a witness in regard to you
  We appointed the kebla which thou formerly hadst, only that we might know him who followeth the apostle, from him who turneth on his heels: The change is a difficulty, but not to those whom God hath guided
 But God will not let your faith58 be fruitless; for unto man is God Merciful, Gracious
  We have seen thee turning thy face towards every part of Heaven; but we will have thee turn to a kebla which shall please thee
 Turn then thy face towards the sacred Mosque,59 and wherever ye be, turn your faces towards that part
 They, verily, to whom "the Book" hath been given, know this to be the truth from their Lord: and God is not regardless of what ye do
  Even though thou shouldest bring every kind of sign to those who have received the Scriptures, yet thy kebla they will not adopt; nor shalt thou adopt their kebla; nor will one part of them adopt the kebla of the other
 And if, after the knowledge which hath come to thee, thou follow their wishes, verily then wilt thou become of the unrighteous
  They to whom we have given the Scriptures know him-the apostle-even as they know their own children: but truly a part of them do conceal the truth, though acquainted with it
60  The truth is from thy Lord
 Be not then of those who doubt
  All have a quarter of the Heavens to which they turn them; but wherever ye be, hasten emulously after good: God will one day bring you all together; verily, God is all-powerful
  And from whatever place thou comest forth, turn thy face toward the sacred Mosque; for this is the truth from thy Lord; and God is not inattentive to your doings
  And from whatever place thou comest forth, turn thy face toward the sacred Mosque; and wherever ye be, to that part turn your faces, lest men have cause of dispute against you: but as for the impious among them, fear them not; but fear me, that I may perfect my favours on you, and that ye may be guided aright
  And we sent to you an apostle from among yourselves to rehearse our signs unto you, and to purify you, and to instruct you in "the Book," and in the wisdom, and to teach you that which ye knew not:  Therefore remember me: I will remember you; and give me thanks and be not ungrateful
  O ye who believe! seek help with patience and with prayer, for God is with the patient
  And say not of those who are slain on God's path61 that they are Dead; nay, they are Living! But ye understand not
  With somewhat of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth, and lives, and fruits, will we surely prove you: but bear good tidings to the patient,  Who when a mischance chanceth them, say, "Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return:"62  On them shall be blessings from their Lord, and mercy: and these!-they are the rightly guided
  Verily, Safa and Marwah63 are among the monuments of God: whoever then maketh a pilgrimage to the temple, or visiteth it, shall not be to blame if he go round about them both
 And as for him who of his own accord doeth what is good-God is Grateful, Knowing
  They who conceal aught that we have sent down, either of clear proof or of guidance, after what we have so clearly shewn to men in the Book,64 God shall curse them, and they who curse shall curse them
  But as for those who turn to me, and amend and make known the truth, even unto them will I turn me, for I am He who Turneth, the Merciful
  Verily, they who are infidels and die infidels,-these! upon them shall be the malison of God and of angels and of all men:  Under it shall they remain for ever: their torment shall not be lightened, and God will not even look upon them!  Your God is one God:65 there is no God but He, the Compassionate, the Merciful
  Assuredly in the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth; and in the alternation of night and day; and in the ships which pass through the sea with what is useful to man; and in the rain which God sendeth down from Heaven, giving life by it to the earth after its death, and by scattering over it all kinds of cattle; and in the change of the winds, and in the clouds that are made to do service between the Heaven and the Earth;-are signs for those who understand
  Yet there are men who take to them idols along with God, and love them with the love of God: But stronger in the faithful is the love of God
 Oh! the impious will see, when they see their chastisement, that all power is God's, and that God is severe in chastising
  When those who have had followers66 shall declare themselves clear from their followers after that they have seen the chastisement, and when the ties between them shall be cut asunder;  The followers shall say, "Could we but return to life we would keep ourselves clear from them, as they have declared themselves clear of us
" So will God shew them their works! Sighing is upon them! but, forth from the fire they come not
  Oh men! eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, but follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your avowed enemy:  He only enjoineth you evil and wickedness, and that ye should aver of God that which ye know not
  And when it is said to them, "Follow ye that which God hath sent down;" they say, "Nay, we follow the usages which we found with our fathers
" What! though their fathers were utterly ignorant and devoid of guidance?  The infidels resemble him who shouteth aloud to one who heareth no more than a call and cry! Deaf, Dumb, blind: therefore they have no understanding
  O ye who believe! eat of the good things with which we have supplied you, and give God thanks if ye are His worshippers
  But that which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that over which any other name than that of God hath been invoked, is forbidden you
 But he who shall partake of them by constraint, without lust or wilfulness, no sin shall be upon him
 Verily God is Indulgent, Merciful
  They truly who hide the Scriptures which God hath sent down, and barter them for a mean price-these shall swallow into their bellies nought but fire
 God will not speak to them, or assoil them, on the day of the Resurrection: and theirs shall be a grievous torment
  These are they who have bartered guidance for error, and pardon for torment; But how great their endurance in fire!67  This shall be their doom, because God had sent down "the Book" with the very truth
 And verily they who dispute about that Book are in a far-gone severance from it
  There is no piety in turning your faces toward the east or the west, but he is pious who believeth in God, and the last day, and the angles, and the Scriptures, and the prophets; who for the love of God disburseth his wealth to his kindred, and to the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and those who ask, and for ransoming; who observeth prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and who is of those who are faithful to their engagements when they have engaged in them, and patient under ills and hardships, and in time of trouble: these are they who are just, and these are they who fear the Lord
  O believers! retaliation for bloodshedding is prescribed to you: the free man for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the woman for the woman: but he to whom his brother shall make any remission,68 is to be dealt with equitably; and to him should he pay a fine with liberality
  This is a relaxation69 from your Lord and a mercy
 For him who after his shall transgress,70 a sore punishment!  But in this law of retaliation is your security for life, O men of understanding! to the intent that ye may fear God
  It is prescribed to you, when any one of you is at the point of death, if he leave goods, that he bequeath equitably to his parents and kindred
 This is binding on those who fear God
 But as for him who after he hath heard the bequest shall change it, surely the wrong of this shall be on those who change it: verily, God Heareth, Knoweth
  But he who feareth from the testator any mistake or wrong, and shall make a settlement between the parties-that shall be no wrong in him: verily, God is Lenient, Merciful
  O believers! a Fast is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may fear God,  For certain days
 But he among you who shall be sick, or on a journey, shall fast that same number of other days: and as for those who are able to keep it and yet break it, the expiation of this shall be the maintenance of a poor man
 And he who of his own accord performeth a good work, shall derive good from it: and good shall it be for you to fast if ye knew it
  As to the month Ramadhan in which the Koran was sent down to be man's guidance, and an explanation of that guidance, and of that illumination,71 as soon as any one of you observeth the moon, let him set about the fast; but he who is sick, or upon a journey, shall fast a like number of other days
 God wisheth you ease, but wisheth not your discomfort, and that you fulfil the number of days, and that you glorify God for his guidance, and that you be thankful
  And when my servants ask thee concerning me, then will I be nigh unto them
 I will answer the cry of him that crieth, when he crieth unto me: but let them hearken unto me, and believe in me, that they may proceed aright
  You are allowed on the night of the fast to approach your wives: they are your garment and ye are their garment
72 God knoweth that ye defraud yourselves therein, so He turneth unto you and forgiveth you! Now, therefore, go in unto them with full desire for that which God hath ordained for you; and eat and drink until ye can discern a white thread from a black thread73 by the daybreak: then fast strictly till night, and go not in unto them, but rather pass the time in the Mosques
 These are the bounds set up by God: therefore come not near them
 Thus God maketh his signs clear to men that they may fear Him
74  Consume not your wealth among yourselves in vain things, nor present it to judges that ye may consume a part of other men's wealth unjustly, while ye know the sin which ye commit
  They will ask thee of the new moons
 SAY: They are periods fixed for man's service and for the Pilgrimage
 There is no piety in entering your houses at the back,75 but piety consists in the fear of God
 Enter your houses then by their doors; and fear God that it may be well with you
  And fight for the cause of God against those who fight against you: but commit not the injustice of attacking them first: God loveth not such injustice:  And kill them wherever ye shall find them, and eject them from whatever place they have ejected you; for civil discord76 is worse than carnage: yet attack them not at the sacred Mosque, unless they attack you therein; but if they attack you, slay them
 Such the reward of the infidels
  But if they desist, then verily God is Gracious, Merciful
  Fight therefore against them until there be no more civil discord, and the only worship be that of God: but if they desist, then let there be no hostility, save against the wicked
  The sacred month and the sacred precincts are under the safeguard of reprisals:77 whoever offereth violence to you, offer ye the like violence to him, and fear God, and know that God is with those who fear Him
  Give freely for the cause of God, and throw not yourselves with your own hands into ruin;78 and do good, for God loveth those who do good
  Accomplish the Pilgrimage and the Visitation79 of the holy places in honour of God: and if ye be hemmed in by foes, send whatever offering shall be the easiest: and shave not your heads until the offering reach the place of sacrifice
 But whoever among you is sick, or hath an ailment of the head, must satisfy by fasting, or alms, or an offering
 And when ye are safe from foes, he who contents himself with the Visitation of the holy places, until the Pilgrimage, shall bring whatever offering shall be the easiest
 But he who findeth nothing to offer, shall fast three days in the Pilgrimage itself, and seven days when ye return: they shall be ten days in all
 This is binding on him whose family shall not be present at the sacred Mosque
 And fear God, and know that God is terrible in punishing
  Let the Pilgrimage be made in the months already known:80 whoever therefore undertaketh the Pilgrimage therein, let him not know a woman, nor transgress, nor wrangle in the Pilgrimage
 The good which ye do, God knoweth it
 And provide for your journey; but the best provision is the fear of God: fear me, then, O men of understanding!  It shall be no crime in you if ye seek an increase from your Lord;81 and when ye pour swiftly on from Arafat, then remember God near the holy monument; and remember Him, because He hath guided you who before this were of those who went astray:  Then pass on quickly82 where the people quickly pass, and ask pardon of God, for God is Forgiving, Merciful
  And when ye have finished your holy rites, remember God as ye remember your own fathers, or with a yet more intense remembrance! Some men there are who say, "O our Lord! give us our portion in this world:" but such shall have no portion in the next life:  And some say, "O our Lord! give us good in this world and good in the next, and keep us from the torment of the fire
"  They shall have the lot which they have merited: and God is swift to reckon
  Bear God in mind during the stated days: but if any haste away83 in two days, it shall be no fault in him: And if any tarry longer, it shall be no fault in him, if he fear God
 Fear God, then, and know that to Him shall ye be gathered
  A man there is84 who surpriseth thee by his discourse concerning this life present
 He taketh God to witness what is in his heart; yet is he the most zealous in opposing thee:  And when he turneth his back on thee, he runneth through the land to enact disorders therein, and layeth waste the fields and flocks: but God loveth not the disorder
  And when it is said to him, "Fear God," the pride of sin seizeth him: but he shall have his fill of Hell; and right wretched the couch!  A man, too, there is85 who selleth his very self out of desire to please God: and God is good to his servants
  O believers! enter completely into the true religion, and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your declared enemy
  But if ye lapse after that our clear signs86 have come to you, know that God is Mighty, Wise
  What can such expect but that God should come down to them overshadowed with clouds, and the angels also, and their doom be sealed? And to God shall all things return
  Ask the children of Isreal how many clear signs we have given them
 But if any man shall alter the boon87 of God after it shall have reached him, assuredly God will be vehement in punishing him
  This present life is prepared for those who believe not, and who mock at the faithful
 But they who fear God shall be above them on the day of resurrection; and God is bounteous without measure to whom He will
  Mankind was but one people;88 and God sent prophets to announce glad tidings and to warn; and He sent down with them the Book of Truth, that it might decide the disputes of men; and none disputed but those to whom the Book had been given, after the clear tokens had reached them,-being full of mutual jealousy
 And God guided those who believed to the truth of that about which, by his permission, they had disputed; for God guideth whom he pleaseth into the straight path
  Think ye to enter Paradise, when no such things have come upon you, as on those who flourish before you? Ills and troubles tried them; and so tossed were they by trials, that the Apostle and they who shared his faith, said, "When will the help of God come?"-Is not the help of God nigh?  They will ask thee what they shall bestow in alms
 SAY: Let the good which ye bestow be for parents, and kindred, and orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer; and whatever good ye do, of a truth God knoweth
  War is prescribed to you: but from this ye are averse
  Yet haply ye are averse from a thing, though it be good for you, and haply ye love a thing though it be bad for you: And God knoweth; but ye, ye know not
  They will ask thee concerning war in the Sacred Month
 SAY: To war therein is bad, but to turn aside from the cause of God, and to have no faith in Him, and in the Sacred Temple, and to drive out its people, is worse in the sight of God; and civil strife is worse than bloodshed
 They will not cease to war against you until they turn you from your religion, if they be able: but whoever of you shall turn from his religion and die an infidel, their works shall be fruitless in this world, and in the next: they shall be consigned to the fire; therein to abide for aye
  But they who believe, and who fly their country, and fight in the cause of God may hope for God's mercy: and God is Gracious, Merciful
  They will ask thee concerning wine89 and games of chance
 SAY: In both is great sin, and advantage also, to men; but their sin is greater than their advantage
 They will ask thee also what they shall bestow in alms:  SAY: What ye can spare
 Thus God sheweth you his signs that ye may ponder  On this present world, and on the next
 They will also ask thee concerning orphans
 SAY: Fair dealing with them is best;  But if ye mix yourselves up (in their affairs)-they are your brethren: God knoweth the foul dealer from the fair: and, if God pleased, he could indeed afflict you! Verily, God is Mighty, Wise
  Marry not idolatresses until they believe; a slave who believeth is better than an idolatress, though she please you more
 And wed not your daughters to idolaters until they believe; for a slave who is a believer, is than better an idolater, though he please you
  They invite to the Fire; but God inviteth to Paradise, and to pardon, if he so will, and maketh clear his signs to men that they may remember
  They will also question thee as to the courses of women
 SAY: They are a pollution
 Separate yourselves therefore from women and approach them not, until they be cleansed
 But when they are cleansed, go in unto them as God hath ordained for you
 Verily God loveth those who turn to Him, and loveth those who seek to be clean
  Your wives are your field: go in, therefore, to your field as ye will; but do first some act for your souls' good: and fear ye God, and know that ye must meet Him; and bear these good tidings to the faithful
  Swear not by God, when ye make oath, that ye will be virtuous and fear God, and promote peace among men; for God is He who Heareth, Knoweth
  God will not punish you for a mistake in your oaths: but He will punish you for that which your hearts have done
 God is Gracious, Merciful
  They who intend to abstain from their wives shall wait four months; but if they go back from their purpose, then verily God is Gracious, Merciful:  And if they resolve on a divorce, then verily God is He who Heareth, Knoweth
  The divorced shall wait the result, until they have had their courses thrice, nor ought they to conceal what God hath created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the last day; and it will be more just in their husbands to bring them back when in this state, if they desire what is right
 And it is for the women to act as they (the husbands) act by them, in all fairness; but the men are a step above them
 God is Mighty, Wise
  Ye may divorce your wives twice: Keep them honourably, or put them away with kindness
 But it is not allowed you to appropriate to yourselves aught of what ye have given to them, unless both fear that they cannot keep within the bounds90 set up by God
 And if ye fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God, no blame shall attach to either of you for what the wife shall herself give for her redemption
 These are the bounds of God: therefore overstep them not; for whoever oversteppeth the bounds of God, they are evil doers
  But if the husband divorce her a third time, it is not lawful for him to take her again, until she shall have married another husband; and if he also divorce her, then shall no blame attach to them if they return to each other, thinking that they can keep within the bounds fixed by God
 And these are the bounds of God; He maketh them clear to those who have knowledge
  But when ye divorce women, and the time for sending them away is come, either retain them with generosity, or put them away with generosity: but retain them not by constraint so as to be unjust towards them
 He who doth so, doth in fact injure himself
 And make not the signs of God a jest; but remember God's favour toward you, and the Book and the Wisdom which He hath sent down to you for your warning, and fear God, and know that God's knowledge embraceth everything
  And when ye divorce your wives, and they have waited the prescribed time, hinder them not from marrying their husbands when they have agreed among themselves in an honourable way
 This warning is for him among you who believeth in God and in the last day
 This is most pure for you, and most decent
 God knoweth, but ye know not
  Mothers, when divorced, shall give suck to their children two full years,91 if the father desire that the suckling be completed; and such maintenance and clothing as is fair for them, shall devolve on the father
 No person shall be charged beyond his means
 A mother shall not be pressed unfairly for her child, nor a father for his child: And the same with the father's heir
 But if they choose to wean the child by consent and by bargain, it shall be no fault in them
 And if ye choose to have a nurse for your children, it shall be no fault in you, in case ye pay what ye promised her according to that which is fair
 Fear God, and know that God seeth what ye do
  If those of you who die leave wives, they must await their state during four months and ten days; and when this their term is expired, you shall not be answerable for the way in which they shall dispose of themselves fairly
 And God is cognisant of what ye do
  And then shall no blame attach to you in making proposals of marriage92 to such women, or in keeping such intention to yourselves? God knoweth that ye will not forget them
 But promise them not in secret, unless ye speak honourable words;  And resolve not on the marriage tie until the prescribed time be reached; and know that God knoweth what is in your minds: therefore, beware of Him; and know that God is Gracious, Mild!  It shall be no crime in you if ye divorce your wives so long as ye have not consummated the marriage, nor settled any dowry on them
 And provide what is needful for them he who is in ample circumstances according to his means, and he who is straitened, according to his means-with fairness: This is binding on those who do what is right
  But if ye divorce them before consummation, and have already settled a dowry on them, ye shall give them half of what ye have settled, unless they make a release, or he make a release in whose hand is the marriage tie
 But if ye make a release, it will be nearer to piety
 And forget not generosity in your relations one towards another; for God beholdeth your doings
  Observe strictly the prayers, and the middle93 prayer, and stand up full of devotion towards God
  And if you have any alarm, then pray on foot or riding: but when you are safe, then remember God, how he hath made you to know what ye knew not
  And94 such of you as shall die and leave wives, shall bequeath their wives a year's maintenance without causing them to quit their homes; but if they quit them of their own accord, then no blame shall attach to you for any disposition they may make of themselves in a fair way
 And God is Mighty, Wise
  And for the divorced let there be a fair provision
 This is a duty in those who fear God
  Thus God maketh his signs clear to you that ye may understand
  Hast thou not thought on those who quitted their dwellings-and they were thousands-for fear of death?95 God said to them, "Die:" then He restored them to life, for full of bounty towards man is God
 But most men give not thanks!  Fight for the cause of God; and know that God is He who Heareth, Knoweth
  Who is he that will lend to God a goodly loan? He will double it to him again and again: God is close, but open handed also: and to Him shall ye return
  Hast thou not considered96 the assembly of the children of Israel after the death of Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, "Set up for us a king; we will do battle for the cause of God?" He said, "May it not be that if to fight were ordained you, ye would not fight?" They said, "And why should we not fight in the cause of God, since we and our children are driven forth from our dwellings?" But when fighting was commanded them, they turned back, save a few of them: But God knew the offenders!  And their prophet said to them, "Now hath God set (Talout) Saul king over you
" They said, "How shall he reign over us, when we are more worthy of the kingdom than he, and of wealth he hath no abundance?" He said, "Verily God hath chosen him to be over you, and hath given him increase in knowledge and stature; God giveth his kingdom to whom he pleaseth; and God is Liberal, Knowing!"  And their prophet said to them, "Verily, the sign of his kingship shall be that the Ark shall come to you: in it is a pledge of security97 from your Lord and the relics98 left by the family of Moses, and the family of Aaron; the angels shall bear it: Truly herein shall be a sign indeed to you if ye are believers
"  And when Saul marched forth with his forces, he said, "God will test you by a river: He who drinketh of it shall not be of my band; but he who shall not taste it, drinking a drink out of the hand excepted, shall be of my band
"99 And, except a few of them, they drank of it
 And when they had passed it, he and those who believed with him, the former said, "We have no strength this day against (Djalout) Goliath and his forces:" But they who held it as certain that they must meet God, said, "How oft, by God's will, hath a small host vanquished a numerous host! and God is with the steadfastly enduring
"  And when they went forth against Goliath and his forces, they said, "O our Lord! pour out steadfastness upon us, and set our feet firm, and help us against the infidels!"  And by the will of God they routed them; and (Daood) David slew Goliath; and God gave him the kingship and wisdom, and taught him according to His will: and were it not for the restraint of one by means of the other, imposed on men by God, verily the earth had been utterly corrupted
 But God is bounteous to his creatures
  Such are the signs of God: with truth do we rehearse them to thee, for one of the Sent Ones art Thou
  Some of the apostles we have endowed more highly than others: Those to whom God hath spoken, He hath raised to the loftiest grade, and to Jesus the Son of Mary we gave manifest signs, and we strengthened him with the Holy Spirit
100 And if God had pleased, they who came after them would not have wrangled, after the clear signs had reached them
 But into disputes101 they fell: some of them believed, and some were infidels; yet if God had pleased, they would not have thus wrangled: but God doth what he will
  O Believers! give alms of that with which we have supplied you, before the day cometh when there shall be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession
 And the infidels are the wrong-doers
  God! There is no God but He; the Living, the Eternal; Nor slumber seizeth Him, nor sleep; His, whatsoever is in the Heavens and whatsoever is in the Earth! Who is he that can intercede with Him but by His own permission? He knoweth what hath been before them and what shall be after them; yet nought of His knowledge shall they grasp, save what He willeth
 His Throne reacheth over the Heavens and the Earth, and the upholding of both burdeneth Him not; and He is the High, the Great!  Let there be no compulsion in Religion
102 Now is the right way made distinct from error
 Whoever therefore shall deny Thagout103 and believe in God-he will have taken hold on a strong handle that shall not be broken: and God is He who Heareth, Knoweth
  God is the patron of believers: He shall bring them out of darkness into light:  As to those who believe not, their patrons are Thagout: they shall bring them out of light into darkness: they shall be given over to the fire: they shall abide therein for ever
  Hast thou not thought on him104 who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, "My Lord is He who maketh alive and cause to die:" He said, "It is I who make alive and cause to die!" Abraham said, "Since God bringeth the sun from the East, do thou, then, bring it from the West
" The infidel was confounded; for God guideth not the evil doers:  Or how he105 demeaned him who passed by a city which had been laid in ruins
106 "How," said he, "shall God give life to this city, after she hath been dead?" And God caused him to die for an hundred years, and then raised him to life
 And God said, "How long hast thou waited?" He said, "I have waited a day or part of a day
" He said, "Nay, thou hast waited an hundred years
 Look on thy food and thy drink; they are not corrupted; and look on thine ass: we would make thee a sign unto men: And look on the bones of thine ass, how we will raise them, then clothe them with flesh
" And when this was shewn to him, he said, "I acknowledge that God hath power to do all things
"  When Abraham said, "O Lord, shew me how thou wilt give life to the dead!" He said, "Hast thou not believed?"  He said, "Yes; but I have asked thee, that my heart may be well assured
" He said, "Take, then, four birds,107 and draw them towards thee, and cut them in pieces; then place a part of them on every mountain; then call them and they shall come swiftly to thee: and know thou that God is Might, Wise!"  The likeness of those who expend their wealth for the cause of God, is that of a grain of corn which produceth seven ears, and in each ear a hundred grains; and God will multiply to whom He pleaseth: God is Liberal, Knowing!  They who expend their wealth for the cause of God, and never follow what they have laid out with reproaches or harm, shall have their reward with their Lord; no fear shall come upon them, neither shall they be put to grief
  A kind speech and forgiveness is better than alms followed by injury
 God is Rich, Clement
  O ye who believe! make not your alms void by reproaches and injury, like him who spendeth his substance to be seen of men, and believeth not in God and in the latter day
 The likeness of such an one is that of a rock with a thin soil upon it, on which a heavy rain falleth but leaveth it hard: No profit from their works shall they be able to gain; for God guideth not the unbelieving people
  And the likeness of those who expend their substance from a desire to please God, and for the stablishing of their souls, is as a garden on a hill, on which the heavy rain falleth, and it yieldeth its fruits twofold; and even if a heavy rain fall not on it, yet is there a dew: God beholdeth your actions
  Desireth any one of you a garden of palms and vines through which rivers flow, in which he may have every fruit, and that old age should surprise him there, and that his offspring should be weakly, and that then a fiery violent wind shall strike it so that it shall be burned? Thus God maketh plain his signs to you that ye may reflect
  O ye who believe! bestow alms of the good things which ye have acquired, and of that which we have brought forth for you out of the earth, and choose not the bad for almsgiving,  Such as ye would accept yourselves only by connivance: and know that God is Rich, Praiseworthy
  Satan menaceth you with poverty,108 and enjoineth base actions: but God promiseth you pardon from himself and abundance: God is All-bounteous, Knowing
  He giveth wisdom to whom He will: and he to whom wisdom is given, hath had much good given him; but none will bear it in mind, except the wise of heart
  And whatever alms ye shall give, or whatever vow ye shall vow, of a truth God knoweth it: but they who act unjustly shall have no helpers
 Give ye your alms openly?109 it is well
 Do ye conceal them and give them to the poor? This, too, will be of advantage to you, and will do away your sins: and God is cognisant of your actions
  Their guidance is not thine affair, O Muhammad; but God guideth whom he pleaseth
 And the good that ye shall give in alms shall redound unto yourselves; and ye shall not give but as seeking the face of God; and whatever good thing ye shall have given in alms, shall be repaid you, and ye shall not be wronged
 There are among you the poor, who being shut up to fighting for the cause of God, have it not in their power to strike out into the earth for riches
 Those who know them not, think them rich because of their modesty
 By this their token thou shalt know them-they ask not of men with importunity: and of whatever good thing ye shall give them in alms, of a truth God will take knowledge
  They who give away their substance in alms, by night and day, in private and in public, shall have their reward with their Lord: no fear shall come on them, neither shall they be put to grief
  They who swallow down usury, shall arise in the resurrection only as he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by his touch
 This, for that they say, "Selling is only the like of usury:" and yet God hath allowed selling, and forbidden usury
 He then who when this warning shall come to him from his Lord, abstaineth, shall have pardon for the past, and his lot shall be with God
 But they who return to usury, shall be given over to the fire; therein shall they abide for ever
  God will bring usury to nought, but will increase alms with usury, and God loveth no infidel, or evil person
 But they who believe and do the things that are right, and observe the prayers, and pay the legal impost, they shall have their reward with their Lord: no fear shall come on them, neither shall they be put to grief
  O believers! fear God and abandon your remaining usury, if ye are indeed believers
  But if ye do it not, then hearken for war on the part of God and his apostle: yet if ye repent, ye shall have the principal of your money
 Wrong not, and ye shall not be wronged
  If any one find difficulty in discharging a debt, then let there be a delay until it be easy for him: but if ye remit it as alms it will be better for you, if ye knew it
  Fear the day wherein ye shall return to God: then shall every soul be rewarded according to its desert, and none shall have injustice done to them
  O ye who believe! when ye contract a debt (payable) at a fixed date, write it down, and let the notary faithfully note between you: and let not the notary refuse to note, even as God hath taught him; but let him note it down, and let him who oweth the debt dictate, and let him fear God his Lord, and not diminish aught thereof
 But if he who oweth the debt be foolish or weak, or be not able to dictate himself, let his friend dictate for him with fairness; and call to witness two witnesses of your people: but if there be not two men, let there be a man, and two women of those whom ye shall judge fit for witnesses: if the one of them should mistake, the other may cause her to recollect
 And the witnesses shall not refuse, whenever they shall be summoned
 And disdain not to put the debt in writing, be it large or small, with its time of payment: this will be more just for you in the sight of God, better suited for witnessing, and the best for avoiding doubt
 But if the goods be there present, and ye pass them from hand to hand-then it shall be no fault in you not to write it down
 And have witnesses when ye sell, and harm not writer or witness: it will be a crime in you to do this
 But fear God and God will give you knowledge, for God hath knowledge of all things
  And if ye be on a journey and shall find no notary, let pledges be taken: but if one of you trust the other, let him who is trusted, restore what he is trusted with, and fear God his Lord
 And refuse not to give evidence
 He who refuseth is surely wicked at heart: and God knoweth your deeds
  Whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's: and whether ye bring forth to light what is in your minds or conceal it, God will reckon with you for it; and whom He pleaseth will He forgive, and whom He pleaseth will He punish; for God is All-powerful
  The apostle believeth in that which hath been sent down from his Lord, as do the faithful also
 Each one believeth in God, and His Angels, and His Books, and His Apostles: we make no distinction between any of His Apostles
110 And they say, "We have heard and we obey
 Thy mercy, Lord! for unto thee must we return
"  God will not burden any soul beyond its power
 It shall enjoy the good which it hath acquired, and shall bear the evil for the acquirement of which it laboured
 O our Lord! punish us not if we forget, or fall into sin; O our Lord! and lay not on us a load like that which thou hast laid on those who have been before us; O our Lord! and lay not on us that for which we have not strength: but blot out our sins and forgive us, and have pity on us
 Thou art our protector: give us victory therefore over the infidel nations

  18 Muhammad rarely accused the Jews and Christians of corrupting, but often of misinterpreting, their Sacred Books, in order to evade his claims

  He hath created the Heavens and the Earth in Truth; and He hath fashioned you and given you goodly forms; and to Him must ye all return
  He knoweth all that passeth in the Heavens and in the Earth; and He knoweth what ye hide and what ye bring to light; and God knoweth the very secrets of men's breasts
  Hath not the story reached you of those who disbelieved of yore, and therefore tasted the evil consequences of their doings? And a sore punishment doth await them
  This, for that when their apostles came to them with the clear tokens, they said, "What! shall men be our guides?" And they believed not and turned their backs
 But God can dispense with them; for God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy!  The infidels pretend that they shall not be raised from the dead
 SAY: Yea, by my Lord, ye shall surely be raised; then shall ye surely be told of your deeds! And easy is this for God
  Believe then in God and his apostle and in the light which we have sent down; for God is fully aware of all ye do
  The day when He shall gather you together for the day of mutual gathering, will be the day of MUTUAL DECEIT,2 and whoso shall have believed in God and done what is right, for him will He cancel his deeds of evil; and He will bring him into the gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow, to abide therein for evermore
 This will be the great bliss!  But the unbelieving-those who gave the lie to our signs-shall be the inmates of the fire, wherein they shall remain for ever
 And a wretched passage thither!  No mischance chanceth but by God's permission; and whoso believeth in God, that man's heart will he guide: and God knoweth all things

It is He who hath sent to the pagan folk (Arabs) an Apostle from among themselves, to rehearse His signs to them, and to purify them, and to impart to them a knowledge of "the Book" and wisdom; for aforetime were they in manifest error
  And others among them have not yet overtaken those who preceded them in the faith
 But He is the Mighty, the Wise!  This is the goodness of God: He bestoweth it on whom He will: God is of immense goodness!  They on whom the burden of the law was laid, and would not bear it, are like an ass beneath a load of books
 A sorry likeness this, for the people who give the lie to the signs of God! God guideth not the people who do this wrong!  SAY: O ye Jews, if ye profess that ye rather than other men are the friends of God, then wish for death if ye are men of truth
  But never on account of their previous handywork will they wish for it, and God knoweth the wrong doers
  SAY: Verily the death from which ye flee will surely meet you
 Then shall ye be brought back to Him who knoweth alike the things done in secret and openly: and He will tell you of your actions
  O ye who believe! When ye are summoned to prayer on the day of THE ASSEMBLY,1 haste to the commemoration of God, and quit your traffic
 This, if ye knew it, will be best for you
  And when the Prayer is ended, then disperse yourselves abroad and go in quest of the bounties of God; and, that it may be well with you, oft remember God

 Therefore, fear God, and settle this among yourselves; and obey God and his apostle, if you are believers
  Believers are they only whose hearts thrill with fear when God is named, and whose faith increaseth at each recital of his signs, and who put their trust in their Lord;  Who observe the prayers, and give alms out of that with which we have supplied them;  These are the believers: their due grade awaiteth them in the presence of their Lord, and forgiveness, and a generous provision
  Remember how thy Lord caused thee to go forth from thy home2 on a mission of truth, and part of the believers were quite averse to it:  They disputed with thee about the truth3 which had been made so clear, as if they were being led forth to death, and saw it before them:  And remember when God promised you that one of the two troops4 should fall to you, and ye desired that they who had no arms should fall to you: but God purposed to prove true the truth of his words, and to cut off the uttermost part ofthe infidels;  That he might prove his truth to be the truth, and bring to nought that which is nought,5 though the impious were averse to it:  When ye sought succour of your Lord, and he answered you, "I will verily aid you with a thousand6 angels, rank on rank:"  And God made this promise as pure good tidings, and to assure your hearts by it: for succour cometh from God alone! Verily God is Mighty, Wise
  Recollect when sleep, a sign of security from Him, fell upon you, and he sent down upon you water from Heaven that he might thereby cleanse you, and cause the pollution of Satan to pass from you, and that he might gird up your hearts, and stablish your feet by it:  When thy Lord spake unto the angels, "I will be with you: therefore stablish ye the faithful

  This, because they have opposed God and his apostle: And whoso shall oppose God and his apostle

  "This for you! Taste it then! and for the infidels is the torture of the fire!"  O ye who believe! when ye meet the marshalled hosts of the infidels, turn not your backs to them:  Whoso shall turn his back to them on that day, unless he turn aside to fight, or to rally to some other troop, shall incur wrath from God: Hell shall be his abode and wretched the journey thither!  So it was not ye who slew them, but God slew them; and those shafts were God's, not thine!7 He would make trial of the faithful by a gracious trial from Himself: Verily, God Heareth, Knoweth
  This befel, that God might also bring to nought the craft of the infidels
  O Meccans! if ye desired a decision, now hath the decision come to you
8 It will be better for you if ye give over the struggle
 If ye return to it, we will return; and your forces, though they be many, shall never avail you aught, for God is with the faithful
  O ye faithful! obey God and his apostle, and turn not away from Him, now that ye hear the truth;  And be not like those who say "We hear," when they hear not;  For the vilest beasts in God's sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who understand not
  Had God known any good in them, he would certainly have made them hear
 But even if He had made them hear, they would certainly have turned back and withdrawn afar
  O ye faithful! make answer to the appeal of God and his apostle when he calleth you to that which giveth you life
 Know that God cometh in between a man and his own heart, and that to him shall ye be gathered
  And be afraid of temptation: the evil doers among you will not be the only ones on whom it will light: And know ye that God is severe in punishment
  And remember when ye were few, and reputed weak in the land:9 ye feared lest men should pluck you away; then was it that He took you in and strengthened you with his help, and supplied you with good things, that haply ye might give thanks
  O ye who believe! deal not falsely with God and his apostle; and be not false in your engagements, with your own knowledge:  And know that your wealth and your children are a temptation; and that God! with Him is a glorious recompense
  O ye who believe! if ye fear God he will make good your deliverance, and will put away your sins from you, and will forgive you
 God is of great bounteousness!  And call to mind when the unbelievers plotted against thee, to detain thee prisoner, or to kill thee, or to banish thee: They plotted-but God plotted: and of plotters is God the best!  And oft as our signs were rehearsed to them, they said, "Now have we heard: if we pleased we could certainly utter its like! Yes, it is mere tales of the ancients
"  And when they said, "God! if this be the very truth from before thee, rain down stones upon us from Heaven, or lay on us some grievous chastisement
"  But God chose not to chastise them while thou wast with them, nor would God chastise them when they sued for pardon
  But because they debarred the faithful from the holy temple, albeit they are not its guardians, nothing is there on their part why God should not chastise them
 The Godfearing only are its guardians; but most of them know it not
  And their prayer at the house of God is no other than whistling through the fingers and clapping of the hands-"Taste then the torment, for that ye have been unbelievers
"  The infidels spend their riches10 with intent to turn men aside from the way of God: spend it they shall; then shall sighing be upon them, and then shall they be overcome
  And the infidels shall be gathered together into Hell,  That God may separate the bad from the good, and put the bad one upon the other, and heap them all up and put them into Hell! These are they who shall be lost
  SAY to the infidels: If they desist from their unbelief, what is now past shall be forgiven them; but if they return to it, they have already before them11 the doom of the ancients!  Fight then against them till strife be at an end, and the religion be all of it God's
 If they desist, verily God beholdeth what they do:  But if they turn their back, know ye that God is your protector: Excellent protector! excellent helper!  And know ye, that when ye have taken any booty, a fifth12 part belongeth to God and to the Apostle, and to the near of kin, and to orphans, and to the poor, and to the wayfarer, if ye believe in God, and in that which we have sent down to our servant on the day of the victory,13 the day of the meeting of the Hosts
 Over all things is God potent
  When ye were encamped on the near side of the valley, and they were on the further side, and the caravan was below you, if ye had made an engagement to attack ye would have failed the engagement; but ye were led into action notwithstanding, that God might accomplish the thing destined to be done:  That he who should perish might perish with a clear token14 before him, and that he who liveth might live with it
 And verily, God Heareth, Knoweth
  Remember when God shewed them to thee in thy dream, as few: Had he shown them numerous, ye would certainly have become fainthearted, and would certainly have disputed about the matter-But from this God kept you-He knoweth the very secrets of the breast-  And when, on your meeting, he made them to appear to your eyes as few, and diminished you in their eyes, that God might carry out the thing that was to be done
15 To God do all things return
  Believers! when ye confront a troop, stand firm and make frequent mention of the name of God, that it may fare well with you:  And obey God and his Apostle; and dispute not, lest ye become fainthearted and your success go from you; but endure with steadfastness, for God is with the steadfastly enduring
  And be not like those Meccans who came out of their houses insolently and to be seen of men, and who turn others from the way of God: God is round about their actions
  When Satan prepared their works for them, and said, "No man shall conquer you this day; and verily I will be near to help you:" But when the two armies came in sight, he turned on his heel and said, "Ay, I am clear of you: ay, I see what ye see not:16 ay, I fear God; for God is severe in punishing
"  When the hypocrites and the diseased of heart said, "Their Religion hath misled the Muslims:17 But whoso putteth his trust in God
 , , ,  Yes, verily God is Mighty, Wise!  If thou didst see, when the angels cause the infidels to die! They smite their faces and their backs, and-"Taste ye the torture of the burning:  This, for what your hands have sent on before you:"-and God is not unjust to his servants
  Their state is like that of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them who believed not in the signs of God: therefore God seized upon them in their sin! God is Mighty, severe in punishing
  This, because God changeth not the favour with which he favoureth a people, so long as they change not what is in their hearts; and for that God Heareth, Knoweth
  Their state is like that of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before them who treated their Lord's signs as lies
 We therefore destroyed them in their sins, and we drowned the people of Pharaoh; for they were all doers of wrong
  The worst beasts truly in the sight of God are the thankless who will not believe;  They with whom thou hast leagued, and who are ever breaking their league, and who fear not God!  If thou take them in war, then, by the example of their fate, scatter those who shall follow them-that they may be warned:  Or if thou fear treachery from any people, throw back their treaty to them as thou fairly mayest,18 for God loveth not the treacherous
  And think not that the infidels shall escape Us! They shall not weaken God
  Make ready then against them what force ye can, and strong squadrons whereby ye may strike terror into the enemy of God and your enemy, and into others beside them whom ye know not, but whom God knoweth
 All that you shall expend for the cause of God shall be repaid you; and ye shall not be wronged
  And if they lean to peace, lean thou also to it; and put thy trust in God: for He is the Hearing, the Knowing
  But if they seek to betray thee, God will be all-sufficient for thee
 He it is who hath strengthened thee with His help, and with the faithful, and hath made their hearts one
 Hadst thou spent all the riches of the earth, thou couldst not have united their hearts; but God hath united them, for He is Mighty, Wise
  O prophet! God, and such of the faithful as follow thee, will be all- sufficient for thee
  O prophet! stir up the faithful to the fight
 Twenty of you who stand firm shall vanquish two hundred: and if there be a hundred of you they shall vanquish a thousand of the infidels, for they are a people devoid of understanding
  Now hath God made your work easy, for he knoweth how weak ye are
 If there be an hundred of you who endure resolutely, they shall vanquish two hundred; and if there be a thousand of you, they shall vanquish two thousand19 by God's permission; for God is with those who are resolute to endure
  No prophet hath been enabled to take captives until he had made great slaughter in the earth
 Ye desire the passing fruitions of this world, but God desireth the next life for you
 And God is Mighty, Wise
  Had there not been a previous ordinance20 from God, a severe chastisement had befallen you, for the ransom which ye took
  Eat therefore of the spoils ye have taken what is lawful and good; and fear God: God is Gracious, Merciful
  O prophet! say to the captives who are in your hands, "If God shall know good21 to be in your hearts, He will give you good beyond all that hath been taken from you, and will forgive you: for God is Forgiving, Merciful
"  But if they seek to deal treacherously with you-they have already dealt treacherously22 with God before! Therefore hath He given you power over them
 God is Knowing, Wise
  Verily, they who have believed and fled their homes and spent their substance for the cause of God, and they who have taken in the prophet and been helpful to him, shall be near of kin the one to the other
 And they who have believed, but have not fled their homes, shall have no rights of kindred with you at all, until they too fly their country
 Yet if they seek aid from you on account of the faith, your part it is to give them aid, except against a people between whom and yourselves there shall be a treaty
 And God beholdeth your actions
  The infidels lend one another mutual help
 Unless ye do the same, there will be discord in the land and great corruption
  But as for those who have believed and fled their country, and fought on the path of God, and given the prophet an asylum, and been helpful to him, these are the faithful; Mercy is their due and a noble provision
  And they who have believed and fled their country since, and have fought at your side, these also are of you
 Those who are united by ties of blood23 are the nearest of kin to each other
 This is in the Book of God
 Verily, God knoweth all things

  3 The necessity for the combat and its probable result
  4 Muhammad had conceived the design of attacking an unarmed caravan belonging to the Koreisch on its way from Syria to Mecca
 Abu Sofian, who had charge of it, sent to Mecca for succour, whence a body of nearly 1000 armed men at once set out to his assistance
 Some of the Muslims were anxious to attack the caravan: others, notwithstanding the disparity of numbers, proposed to throw themselves upon the succours

-MUHAMMAD [XCVI
]  MEDINA
-40 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  WHOSO believe not, and prevent others from the way of God-their works will He cause to miscarry;2  But whoso believe, and do things that are right, and believe in what hath been sent down to MUHAMMAD-for it is the truth from their Lord-their sins will He cancel, and dispose their hearts aright
  This-because the infidels followed vanity, while those who believe, followed the truth from their Lord
 Thus to men doth God set forth their likenesses
  When ye encounter the infidels,3 strike off their heads till ye have made a great slaughter among them, and of the rest make fast the fetters
  And afterwards let there either be free dismissals or ransomings, till the war hath laid down its burdens
 Thus do
 Were such the pleasure of God, he could himself take vengeance upon them: but He would rather prove the one of you by the other
 And whoso fight for the cause of God, their works he will not suffer to miscarry;  He will vouchsafe them guidance, and dispose their hearts aright;  And he will bring them into the Paradise, of which he hath told them
  Believers! if ye help God, God will help you, and will set your feet firm:  But as for the infidels, let them perish: and their works shall God bring to nought:  This-because they were averse from the command which God sent down; Fruitless, therefore, shall their works become!  Have they not journeyed through the land, and seen what hath been the end of those who flourished before them? God brought destruction on them: and the like of this doth await the infidels
  This-because God is the protector of those who believe, and because the infidels have no protector
  Verily God will bring those who believe, and do the things that are right, into the Gardens, beneath whose shades the rivers flow: but they who believe not, take their fill, and eat as the beasts eat! And their dwelling-place the fire!  And how many cities were mightier in strength than thy city, which hath thrust thee forth!4 We destroyed them, and there was none to help them
  Shall he who followeth the clear teaching of his Lord be as he, the evil of whose doings hath been made to seem good to him, or like those who follow their own lusts?  A picture of the Paradise which is promised to the God-fearing! Therein are rivers of water, which corrupt not: rivers of milk, whose taste changeth not: and rivers of wine, delicious to those who quaff it;  And rivers of honey clarified: and therein are all kinds of fruit for them from their Lord! Is this like the lot of those who must dwell for ever in the fire? and shall have draughts of boiling water forced on them which will rend their bowels asunder?  Some of them indeed hearken to thee, until when they go out from thee, they say with sneers to those to whom "the knowledge" hath been given, "What is this he said?" These are they whose hearts God hath sealed up, and who follow their own lusts
  But as to those who have the guidance, He will increase their guidance, and He will teach them what to fear
  For what do the infidels wait, but that the Hour come suddenly on them? Already are its signs come,5 and when it hath come on them indeed, how can they be warned then?  Know, then, that there is no god but God: and ask pardon for thy sin, and for believers, both men and women
 God knoweth your busy movements, and your final resting-places
  The believers say, "Oh, would that a Sura were sent down!"6 but when a peremptory Sura is revealed, whose burden is war, thou mayest see the diseased of heart look toward thee, with a look of one on whom the shadows of death have fallen! But better in them would be obedience and becoming language
  And if, when the command for war is issued, they are true to God, it will be assuredly best for them
  Were ye not ready, if ye had turned back from Him, to spread disorder in the land, and violate the ties of blood?  These are they whom God hath cursed, and made deaf, and blinded their eyes!  Will they not then meditate on the Koran? Are locks upon their hearts?  But as to those who return to their errors after "the guidance" hath been made plain to them, Satan shall beguile them, and fill them with his suggestions
  This-because they say to those who abhor what God hath sent down, "We will comply with you in part of what ye enjoin
" But God knoweth their secret reservations
  But how? When the angels, in causing them to die, shall smite them on the face and back!  This because they follow that which angereth God, and abhor what pleaseth Him: therefore will He make their works fruitless
  Think these men of diseased hearts, that God will not bring out their malice to light?  If such were our pleasure, we could point them out to thee, and thou surely know them by their tokens: and know them thou shalt, by the strangeness of their words
7 God knoweth your doings
  And we will surely test you, until we know the valiant and the steadfast among you: and we will test the reports of your conduct
  Verily they who believe not, and turn others from the way of God, and separate from the Apostle after that "the guidance" hath been clearly shewn them, shall in no way injure God: but their works shall he bring to nought
  Believers! obey God and the Apostle: and render not your works vain
  Verily those who believe not, and who pervert others from the way of God, and then die in unbelief, God will not forgive
  Be not fainthearted then; and invite not the infidels to peace when ye have the upper hand: for God is with you, and will not defraud you of the recompense of your works
  Surely this present life is only a play, and pastime! but if ye believe, fear God; He will give you your rewards: but He will not ask all your riches of you
  Should He ask them of you, and urge you, ye would shew yourself niggards: and He would bring your grudges to light
  Lo! ye are they, who are called to expend for the cause of God: and some of you are niggards: but whoso is niggardly shall be niggard only to his own loss; for God is the Rich, and ye are the poor: and if ye turn back, He will change you for another people,8 and they shall not be your like!   _______________________  1 This Sura was revealed at a period after the victory at Bedr, when there was still some hesitation on the part of Muhammad's followers to take decided steps for securing their position

 LAM
 MIM
2 God! there is no god but He, the Living, the Merciful!  In truth hath He sent down to thee "the Book," which confirmeth those which precede it: For He had sent down the Law, and the Evangel aforetime, as man's Guidance; and now hath He sent down the "Illumination
"3 (Furkan
)  Verily for those who believe not in the signs of God, is a severe chastisement! And God is Mighty, the Avenger!  God! nought that is in Earth or that is in Heaven, is hidden unto Him
 He it is who formeth you in your mothers' wombs
 There is no god but He; the Mighty, the Wise!  He it is who hath sent down to thee "the Book
" Some of its signs are of themselves perspicuous;-these are the basis4 of the Book-and others are figurative
 But they whose hearts are given to err, follow its figures, craving discord, craving an interpretation; yet none knoweth its interpretation but God
 And the stable in knowledge say, "We believe in it: it is all from our Lord
" But none will bear this in mind, save men endued with understanding
  O our Lord! suffer not our hearts to go astray after that thou hast once guided us, and give us mercy from before thee; for verily thou art He who giveth
  O our Lord! For the day of whose coming there is not a doubt, thou wilt surely gather mankind together
 Verily, God will not fail the promise
  As for the infidels, their wealth, and their children, shall avail them nothing against God
 They shall be fuel for the fire
  After the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those who went before them, they treated our signs as falsehoods
 Therefore God laid hold of them in their sins; and God is severe in punishing!  Say to the infidels: ye shall be worsted, and to Hell shall ye be gathered together; and wretched the couch!  Ye have already had a sign5 in the meeting of the two hosts
 The one host fought in the cause of God, and the other was infidel
 To their own eyesight, the infidels saw you twice as many as themselves: And God aided with his succour whom He would: And in this truly was a lesson for men endued with discernment
  Fair-seeming to men is the love of pleasures from women and children, and the treasured treasures of gold and silver, and horses of mark, and flocks, and cornfields! Such the enjoyment of this world's life
 But God! goodly the home with Him
  SAY: Shall I tell you of better things than these, prepared for those who fear God, in His presence? Theirs shall be gardens, beneath whose pavilions the rivers flow, and in which shall they abide for aye: and wives of stainless purity, and acceptance with God: for God regardeth his servants-  Who say, "O our Lord! we have indeed believed; pardon us our sins, and keep us from the torment of the fire;"-  The patient, and the truthful, the lowly, and the charitable, and they who seek pardon at each daybreak
  God witnesseth that there is no god but He: and the angels, and men endued with knowledge, stablished in righteousness, proclaim "There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise!"  The true religion with God is Islam: and they to whom the Scriptures had been given, differed not till after "the knowledge"6 had come to them, and through mutual jealousy
 But as for him who shall not believe in the signs of God-God will be prompt to reckon with him!  If they shall dispute with thee, then SAY: I have surrendered myself to God, as have they who follow me
  SAY to those who have received the Book, and to the common folk, Do ye surrender yourselves unto God?7 If they become Muslims, then are they guided aright: but if they turn away-thy duty is only preaching; and God's eye is on His servants
  But to those who believe not in the signs of God, and unjustly slay the prophets, and slay those men who enjoin uprightness,-announce an afflictive chastisement
  These are they whose works come to nought in this world, and in the next; and none shall they have to help them!  Hast thou not marked those who have received a portion of the Scriptures, when they are summoned to the Book of God, that it may settle their differences? Then did a part of them turn back, and withdrew far off
  This-because they said, "The fire shall by no means touch us, but for certain days:"-Their own devices have deceived them in their religion
  But how, when we shall assemble them together for the day of (which) whose coming there is no doubt, and when every soul shall be paid what it hath earned, and they shall not be wronged?  SAY: O God, possessor of all power,8 thou givest power to whom thou wilt, and from whom thou wilt, thou takest it away! Thou raisest up whom thou wilt, and whom thou wilt thou dost abase! In thy hand is good; for thou art over all things potent
  Thou causest the night to pass into the day, and thou causest the day to pass into the night
 Thou bringest the living out of the dead, and thou bringest the dead out of the living; and thou givest sustenance to whom thou wilt, without measure
  Let not believers take infidels for their friends rather than believers: whoso shall do this hath nothing to hope from God-unless, indeed, ye fear a fear from them: But God would have you beware of Himself; for to God ye return
 SAY: Whether ye hide what is in your breasts, or whether ye publish it abroad, God knoweth it: He knoweth what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and over all things is God potent
  On that day shall every soul find present to it, whatever it hath wrought of good: and as to what it hath wrought of evil, it will wish that wide were the space between itself and it! But God would have you beware of Himself; for God is kind to His servants
  SAY: If ye love God, then follow me: God will love you, and forgive your sins, for God is Forgiving, Merciful
 SAY: Obey God and the Apostle; but if ye turn away, then verily, God loveth not the unbelievers
  Verily above all human beings did God choose Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of IMRAN, the one the posterity of the other: And God Heareth, Knoweth
  Remember when the wife of Imran9 said, "O my Lord! I vow to thee what is in my womb, for thy special service
 Accept it from me, for thou Hearest, Knowest!" And when she had given birth to it, she said, "O my Lord! Verily I have brought forth a female,"-God knew what she had brought forth; a male is not as a female10-"and I have named her Mary, and I take refuge with thee for her and for her offspring, from Satan the stoned
"11  So with goodly acceptance did her Lord accept her, and with goodly growth did he make her grow
12 Zacharias reared her
 So oft as Zacharias went in to Mary at the sanctuary, he found her supplied with food
13 "Oh, Mary!" said he, "whence hast thou this?" She said, "It is from God; for God supplieth whom He will, without reckoning!"  There did Zacharias call upon his Lord: "O my Lord!" said he, "vouchsafe me from thyself good descendants,14 for thou art the hearer of prayer
" Then did the angels call to him, as he stood praying in the sanctuary:15  "God announceth John (Yahia) to thee, who shall be a verifier of the word from God, and a great one, chaste, and a prophet of the number of the just
"  He said, "O my Lord! how shall I have a son, now that old age hath come upon me, and my wife is barren?" He said, "Thus will God do His pleasure
"  He said, "Lord! give me a token
" He said, "Thy token shall be, that for three days thou shalt speak to no man but by signs: But remember thy Lord often, and praise him at even and at morn:"  And remember when the angels said, "O Mary! verily hath God chosen thee,16 and purified thee, and chosen thee above the women of the worlds!  O Mary! be devout towards thy Lord,17 and prostrate thyself, and bow down with those who bow
"  This is one of the announcements of things unseen by thee: To thee, O Muhammad! do we reveal it; for thou wast not with them when they cast lots with reeds18 which of them should rear Mary; nor wast thou with them when they disputed about it
  Remember when the angel said, "O Mary! Verily God announceth to thee the Word from Him: His name shall be, Messiah Jesus the son of Mary,19 illustrious in this world, and in the next, and one of those who have near access to God;  And He shall speak to men alike when in the cradle and when grown up; And he shall be one of the just
"  She said, "How, O my Lord! shall I have a son, when man hath not touched me?" He said, "Thus: God will create what He will; When He decreeth a thing, He only saith, 'Be,' and it is
"  And he will teach him the Book, and the Wisdom, and the Law, and the Evangel; and he shall be an apostle to the children of Israel
 "Now have I come," he will say, "to you with a sign from your Lord: Out of clay will I make for you, as it were, the figure of a bird: and I will breathe into it, and it shall become, by God's leave, a bird
20 And I will heal the blind, and the leper; and by God's leave will I quicken the dead; and I will tell you what ye eat, and what ye store up in your houses! Truly in this will be a sign for you, if ye are believers
  And I have come to attest the law which was before me; and to allow you part of that which had been forbidden you; and I come to you with a sign from your Lord: Fear God, then, and obey me; of a truth God is my Lord, and your Lord: Therefore worship Him
 This is a right way
"  And when Jesus perceived unbelief on their part, He said, "Who my helpers with God?"20-21 The apostles21 said, "We will be God's helpers! We believe in God, and bear thou witness that we are Muslims
  O our Lord! we believe in what thou hast sent down, and we follow the apostle; write us up, then, with those who bear witness to him
"  And the Jews plotted, and God plotted: But of those who plot is God the best
  Remember when God said, "O Jesus! verily I will cause thee to die,22 and will take thee up to myself and deliver thee from those who believe not; and I will place those who follow thee above those who believe not, until the day of resurrection
 Then, to me is your return, and wherein ye differ will I decide between you
  And as to those who believe not, I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world and in the next; and none shall they have to help them
"  But as to those who believe, and do the things that are right, He will pay them their recompense
 God loveth not the doers of evil
  These signs, and this wise warning do we rehearse to thee
  Verily, Jesus is as Adam in the sight of God
23 He created him of dust: He then said to him, "Be"-and he was
  The truth from thy Lord! Be not thou, therefore, of those who doubt
  As for those 24 who dispute with thee about Him, after "theknowledge" hath come to thee, SAY: Come,25 let us summon our sons and your sons, our wives and your wives, and ourselves and yourselves
 Then will we invoke and lay the malison of God on those that lie!  This recital is very truth, and there is no god but God; and verily God is the Mighty, the Wise
  But if they turn away, then verily God hath knowledge of the corrupt doers
  SAY: O people of the Book! come ye to a just judgment between us and you-That we worship not aught but God, and that we join no other god with Him, and that the one of us take not the other for lords,26 beside God
 Then if they turn their backs, SAY: Bear ye witness that we are Muslims
  O people of the Book! Why dispute about Abraham,27 when the Law and the Evangel were not sent down till after him? Do ye not then understand?  Lo! ye are they who dispute about that in which ye have knowledge; 28 but why dispute ye about that of which ye have no knowledge? God hath knowledge, but ye know nothing
  Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian; but he was sound in the faith,29 a Muslim; and not of those who add gods to God
  They among men, who are nearest of kin to Abraham, are surely those who follow him, and this prophet Muhammad, and they who believe on him
 And God is the protector of the faithful
  A party among the people of the Book would fain mislead you: but they only mislead themselves, and perceive it not
  O people of the Book! why disbelieve the signs of God, of which yourselves have been witnesses?  O people of the Book! why clothe ye the truth with falsehood? Why wittingly hide the truth?  Others of the people of the Book say: "Believe in what hath been sent down to the believers, at daybreak, and deny it at its close"-Thus do they go back-  "And believe in those only who follow your Religion
" SAY: True guidance is guidance from God-that to others may be imparted the like of what hath been imparted to you
 Will they wrangle then with you in the presence of their Lord? SAY: Plenteous gifts are in the hands of God: He imparteth them unto whom He will, and God is Bounteous, Wise
  He will vouchsafe His mercy to whom He will, for God is of great bounteousness
  Among the people of the Book are some, to one of whom if thou entrust a thousand dinars, he will restore them to thee: And there is of them to whom if thou entrust a dinar, he will not restore it to thee, unless thou be ever instant with him
  This-because they say, "We are not bound to keep faith with the ignorant (Pagan) folk, and they utter a lie against God, and know they do so:"  But whoso is true to his engagement, and feareth God,-verily God loveth those that fear Him
  Verily they who barter their engagement with God, and their oaths, for some paltry price-These! no portion for them in the world to come! and God will not speak to them, and will not look on them, on the day of resurrection, and will not assoil them! for them, a grievous chastisement!  And some truly are there among them who torture the Scriptures with their tongues, in order that ye may suppose it to be from the Scripture, yet it is not from the Scripture
 And they say, "This is from God;" yet it is not from God: and they utter a lie against God, and they know they do so
  It beseemeth not a man, that God should give him the Scriptures and the Wisdom, and the gift of prophecy, and that then he should say to his followers, "Be ye worshippers of me, as well as of God;" 30 but rather, "Be ye perfect in things pertaining to God, since ye know the Scriptures, and have studied deep
"  God doth not command you to take the angels or the prophets as lords
31 What! would he command you to become infidels after ye have been Muslims?  When God entered into covenant with the prophets,32 he said, "This is the Book and the Wisdom which I give you
 Hereafter shall a prophet came unto you to confirm the Scriptures already with you
 Ye shall surely believe on him, and ye shall surely aid him
 Are ye resolved?" said he, "and do ye accept the covenant on these terms?" They said, "We are resolved;" "Be ye then the witnesses," said he, "and I will be a witness as well as you
  And whoever turneth back after this, these are surely the perverse
"  Other religion than that of God desire they? To him doth everything that is in the Heavens and in the Earth submit, in willing or forced obedience! and to Him do they return
  SAY: We believe in God, and in what hath been sent down to us, and what hath been sent down to Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and in what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the Prophets, from their Lord
 We make no difference between them
 And to Him are we resigned (Muslims)
  Whoso desireth any other religion than Islam, that religion shall never be accepted from him, and in the next world he shall be among the lost
  How shall God guide a people who, after they had believed and bore witness that the apostle was true, and after that clear proofs of his mission had reached them, disbelieved? God guideth not the people who transgress
  These! their recompense, that the curse of God, and of angels, and of all men, is on them!  Under it shall they abide for ever; their torment shall not be assuaged! nor shall God even look upon them!-  Save those who after this repent and amend; for verily God is Gracious, Merciful!  As for those who become infidels, after having believed, and then increase their infidelity-their repentance shall never be accepted
 These! they are the erring ones
  As for those who are infidels, and die infidels, from no one of them shall as much gold as the earth could contain be accepted, though he should offer it in ransom
 These! a grievous punishment awaiteth them; and they shall have none to help them
  Ye shall never attain to goodness till ye give alms of that which ye love; and whatever ye give, of a truth God knoweth it
  All food was allowed to the children of Israel, except what Jacob forbad himself, ere the law was sent down; SAY: Bring ye then the law and read it, if ye be men of truth
  And whoso after this inventeth the lie about God: These are evil doers
  SAY: God speaketh truth
 Follow, therefore, the religion of Abraham, the sound in faith, who was not one of those who joined other gods to God
  The first temple that was founded for mankind, was that in Becca,33-Blessed, and a guidance to human beings
  In it are evident signs, even the standing-place34 of Abraham: and he who entereth it is safe
 And the pilgrimage to the temple, is a service due to God from those who are able to journey thither
  And as to him who believeth not-verily God can afford to dispense with all creatures!  SAY: O people of the Book! why disbelieve ye the signs of God? But God is witness of your doings
  SAY: O people of the Book! why repel believers from the way of God? Ye fain would make it crooked, and yet ye are its witnesses! But God is not regardless of what ye do
  O believers! if ye obey some amongst those who have received the Scripture, after your very Faith will they make you infidels!  But how can ye become infidels, when the signs of God are recited to you, and his prophet is among you? Whoever holdeth fast by God, is already guided to a straight path
  O ye believers! fear God as He deserveth to be feared! and die not till ye have become Muslims
  And hold ye fast by the cord 35 of God, all of you, and break not loose from it; and remember God's goodness towards you, how that when ye were enemies, He united your hearts, and by his favour ye became brethren;  And when ye were on the brink of the pit of fire, he drew you back from it
 Thus God clearly sheweth you his signs that ye may be guided;  And that there may be among you a people who invite to the Good, and enjoin the Just, and forbid the Wrong
 These are they with whom it shall be well
  And be ye not like those who have formed divisions, and fallen to variance after the clear proofs have come to them
 These! a terrible chastisement doth await them,  On THE DAY when faces shall turn white, and faces shall turn black! And as to those whose faces shall have turned black "
 
 
 
What! after your belief have ye become infidels? Taste then the chastisement, for that ye have been unbelievers
"  And as to those whose faces shall have become white, they shall be within the mercy of God: therein shall they abide for ever
  These are the signs of God: we recite them to thee in truth: And God willeth not injustice to mankind
  Whatever is in the Heavens, and whatever is on the Earth, is God's
 And to God shall all things return
  Ye are the best folk that hath been raised up unto mankind
 Ye enjoin the Just, and ye forbid the Evil, and ye believe in God: And if the people of the Book had believed, it had surely been better for them! Believers there are among them, but most of them are perverse
  They will never inflict on you but a trifling damage; and if they do battle with you, they shall turn their backs to you: then they shall not be succoured
  Shame shall be stamped upon them36 wherever found, unless they ally them with God and men! And the wrath of God will they incur, and poverty shall be stamped upon them! This-for that they believed not in the signs of God, and slew the prophets unjustly: This-because they rebelled, and became transgressors
  Yet all are not alike: Among the people of the Book is an upright folk, who recite the signs of God in the night-season, and adore:  They believe in God and in the latter day, and enjoin justice, and forbid evil, and speed on in good works
 These are of the righteous
  And of whatever good ye do, ye shall not be denied the meed
 God knoweth those who fear Him
  But as for the infidels, their wealth, and their children shall avail them nothing against God
 They shall be the inmates of the fire, to abide therein eternally
  The alms which they bestow in this present life, are like a freezing wind, which falleth upon and destroyeth the cornfields of a people who have been to themselves unjust
 God doeth them no injustice, but to themselves are they unjust
  O ye who have believed! form not intimacies among others than yourselves
 They will not fail to corrupt you
 They long for your ruin
 Hatred hath already shewn itself out of their mouths, but more grievous is what their breasts conceal
 The tokens thereof we have already made plain to you, if ye will comprehend
  See now! ye love them, but they love not you
 Ye believe the entire Book
 And when they meet you, they say, "We believe;" but when they are apart, they bite their fingers' ends at you, out of wrath
 SAY: "Die in your wrath!" God truly knoweth the very recesses of your breasts
  If good befalleth you it grieveth them, and when ill lighteth on you, they rejoice in it
 But if ye be steadfast and fear God, their craft shall in no way harm you
 For God is round about their doings
  And remember when thou didst leave thy household at early morn, that thou mightest prepare the faithful a camp for the war;37-God heard, knew it-  When two troops of you became full of anxious thoughts, and lost heart, and when God became the protector of both! In God, then, let the faithful trust
  God had already succoured you at Bedr, when ye were the weaker! Fear God, then, that ye may be thankful
  Then thou didst say to the faithful, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord aideth you with three thousand angels sent down from on high?"  Aye: but ye if be steadfast and fear God, and the foe come upon you in hot haste, your Lord will help you with five thousand angels in their cognisances!38  This, as pure good tidings for you, did God appoint, that your hearts might be assured-for only from God, the Mighty, the Wise, cometh the Victory-and that He might cut off the uttermost part of those who believed not, or cast them down so that they should be overthrown, defeated without resource
  It is none of thy concern whether He be turned unto them in kindness or chastise them: for verily they are wrongful doers
  Whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth is God's! He forgiveth whom He will, and whom He will, chastiseth: for God is Forgiving, Merciful
  O ye who believe! devour not usury, doubling it again and again! But fear God, that ye may prosper
  And fear the fire which is prepared for them that believe not; and obey God and the apostle, that ye may find mercy:  And vie in haste for pardon from your Lord, and a Paradise, vast as the Heavens and the Earth, prepared for the God-fearing
  Who give alms, alike in prosperity and in success, and who master their anger, and forgive others! God loveth the doers of good
  They who, after they have done a base deed or committed a wrong against their own selves, remember God and implore forgiveness of their sins-and who will forgive sins but God only?-and persevere not in what they have wittingly done amiss
  As for these! Pardon from their Lord shall be their recompense, and gardens 'neath which the rivers flow; for ever shall they abide therein: And goodly the reward of those who labour!  Already, before your time, have examples been made! Traverse the earth, then, and see what hath been the end of those who treat prophets as liars
  This Koran is a manifest to man, and a guidance, and a warning to the God- fearing!  And be not fainthearted, and be not sorrowful: For ye shall gain the upper hand if ye be believers
39  If a wound hath befallen you, a wound like it hath already befallen others: we alternate these days of successes and reverses among men, that God may know those who have believed, and that He may take martyrs from among you,- but God loveth not the wrongful doers-  And that God may test those who believe, and destroy the infidels
  Thought ye that ye should enter Paradise ere God had taken knowledge of those among you who did valiantly, and of those who steadfastly endure?  Ye had desired death ere ye met it
 But ye have now seen it-and ye have beheld it-and fled from it!  Muhammad is no more than an apostle; other apostles have already passed away before him: if he die, therefore,40 or be slain, will ye turn upon your heels?41 But he who turneth on his heels shall not injure God at all: And God will certainly reward the thankful!  No one can die except by God's permission, according to the Book that fixeth the term of life
42 He who desireth the recompense of this world, we will give him thereof; And he who desireth the recompense of the next life, we will give him thereof! And we will certainly reward the thankful
  How many a prophet hath combated those who had with them many myriads! Yet were they not daunted at what befel them on the path of God, nor were they weakened, nor did they basely submit! God loveth those who endure with steadfastness,  Nor said they more than this:43 "O our Lord! forgive us our sins and our mistakes in this our work; and set our feet firm; and help us against the unbelieving people
" And God gave them the recompense of this world, and the excellence of the recompense of the next
 For God loveth the doers of what is excellent
  O ye who have believed! if ye obey the infidels, they will cause you to turn upon your heels,44 and ye will fall back into perdition:  But God is your liege lord, and He is the best of helpers
  We will cast a dread into hearts of the infidels because they have joined gods with God without warranty sent down; their abode shall be the fire; and wretched shall be the mansion of the evil doers
  Already had God made good to you His promise, when by His permission ye destroyed your foes, until your courage failed you, and ye disputed about the order,45 and disobeyed, after that the Prophet had brought you within view of that for which ye longed
46  Some of you were for this world, and some for the next
47 Then, in order to make trial of you, He turned you to flight from them,-yet hath He now forgiven you; for all-bounteous is God to the faithful-  When ye came up the height48 and took no heed of any one, while the Prophet in your rear was calling you to the fight! God hath rewarded you with trouble upon trouble, that ye might learn not to be chagrined at your loss of booty, or at what befel you! God is acquainted with your actions
  Then after the trouble God sent down security upon you
 Slumber fell upon a part of you: as to the other part-their own passions stirred them up to think unjustly of God with thoughts of ignorance! They said-What gain we by this affair? SAY: Verily the affair resteth wholly with God
 They hid in their minds what they did not speak out to thee, saying, "Were we to have gained aught in this affair, none of us had been slain at this place
" SAY: Had ye remained in your homes, they who were decreed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they lie:-in order that God might make trial of what was in your breasts, and might discover what was in your hearts, for God knoweth the very secrets of the breast
  Of a truth it was Satan alone who caused those of you to fail in duty who turned back on the day when the hosts met, for some of their doings! But now hath God pardoned them; For God is Forgiving, Gracious
  O ye who believe! be not like the infidels, who said of their brethren when they had travelled by land or had gone forth to war, "Had they kept with us, they had not died, and had not been slain!" God purposed that this affair should cause them heart sorrow! God maketh alive and killeth; and God beholdeth your actions
  And if ye shall be slain or die on the path of God, then pardon from God and mercy is better than all your amassings;  For if ye die or be slain, verily unto God shall ye be gathered
  Of the mercy of God thou hast spoken to them in gentle terms
 Hadst thou been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from thee
 Therefore, forgive and ask for pardon for them, and consult them in the affair of war, and when thou art resolved, then put thou thy trust in God, for God loveth those who trust in Him
  If God help you, none shall overcome you; but if He abandon you, who is he that shall help you when He is gone? In God, then, let the faithful trust
  It is not the Prophet who will defraud you;49-But he who shall defraud, shall come forth with his defraudings on the day of the resurrection: then shall every soul be paid what it hath merited, and they shall not be treated with injustice
  Shall he who hath followed the good pleasure of God be as he who hath brought on himself wrath from God, and whose abode shall be Hell? and wretched the journey thither!  There are varying grades with God: and God beholdeth what ye do
  Now hath God been gracious to the faithful, when he raised up among them an apostle out of their own people, to rehearse unto them his signs, and to cleanse them, and to give them knowledge of the Book and of Wisdom: for before they were in manifest error
  When a reverse hath befallen you,50 the like of which ye had before inflicted, say ye, "Whence is this?" SAY: It is from yourselves
 For God hath power over all things
  And that which befel you on the day when the armies met, was certainly by the will of God, and that he might know the faithful, and that he might know the hypocrites! And when the word was "Advance, fight on the path of God, or drive back the foe,"-they said, "Had we known how to fight, we would have followed you
" Nearer were some of them on that day to unbelief, than to faith:  They said with their lips what was not in their hearts! But God knew what they concealed,  Who said of their brethren while themselves sat at home,  "Had they obeyed us, they had not been slain
" SAY: Keep back death from yourselves if ye speak truth
  And repute not those slain on God's path to be dead
51 Nay, alive with their Lord, are they richly sustained;  Rejoicing in what God of his bounty hath vouchsafed them, filled with joy for those who follow after them, but have not yet overtaken them, that on them nor fear shall come, nor grief;  Filled with joy at the favours of God, and at his bounty: and that God suffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish
  As to those who after the reverse52 which befel them, respond to God and the Apostle-such of them as do good works and fear God, shall have a great reward:  Who, when men said to them, "Now are the Meccans mustering against you; therefore fear them!" it only increased their faith, and they said, "Our sufficiency is God, and He is an excellent protector
"  They returned, therefore, with the favour of God, enriched by Him, and untouched by harm; and they followed what was well pleasing to God
 And God is of great Munificence
  Only would that Satan53 instil the fear of his adherents: Fear them not, but fear me if ye are believers
  Let not those who vie in haste after infidelity grieve thee: Verily not one whit shall they injure God! God will refuse them all part in the life to come: a severe chastisement shall be their lot
  They truly who purchase infidelity at the price of their faith, shall not injure God one whit! and a grievous chastisement shall be their lot
  Let not the infidels deem that the length of days we give them is good for them! We only give them length of days that they may increase their sins! and a shameful chastisement shall be their lot
  It is not in God to leave the faithful in the State in which they are, until he sever the bad from the good:  Nor is God minded to lay open the secret things to you, but God chooseth whom he will of his apostles to know them
54 Believe, therefore, in God and his apostles: and if ye believe and fear God, a great reward awaiteth you
  And let not those who are niggard of what God hath vouchsafed them in his bounty, think that this will be good for them-Nay, it will be bad for them-  That of which they have been niggard shall be their collar on the day of the resurrection
 God's, the heritage of the Heavens and of the Earth! And God is well-informed of all ye do
  Now hath God heard the saying of those who said: "Aye, God is poor and we are rich
"55 We will surely write down their sayings, and their unjust slaughter of the prophets; and and we will say, "Taste ye the torment of the burning
  This, for what your hands have sent before you; and because God will not inflict a wrong upon his servants!"  To those who say, "Verily, God hath enjoined us that we are not to credit an apostle until he present us a sacrifice which fire out of Heaven shall devour,"  SAY: Already have apostles before me come to you with miracles, and with that of which ye speak
 Wherefore slew ye them? Tell me, if ye are men of truth
  And if they treat thee as a liar, then verily apostles have been treated as liars before thee, though they came with clear proofs of their mission, and with Scriptures, and with the light-giving Book
  Every soul shall taste of death: and ye shall only receive your recompenses on the day of resurrection
 And whoso shall scape the fire, and be brought into Paradise, shall be happy
 And the life of this world is but a cheating fruition!  Ye shall assuredly be tried in your possessions and in yourselves
 And many hurtful things shall ye assuredly hear from those to whom the Scriptures were given before you, and from those who join other gods with God
 But if ye be steadfast, and fear God this verily is needed in the affairs of life
  Moreover, when God entered into a convenant with those to whom the Scriptures had been given, and said, "Ye shall surely make it known to mankind and not hide it," they cast it behind their backs, and sold it for a sorry price! But vile is that for which they have sold it
  Suppose not that they who rejoice in what they have brought to pass, and love to be praised for what they have not done56-suppose not they shall escape the chastisement
 An afflictive chastisement doth await them,  For the Kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth is God's, and God hath power over all things
  Verily, in the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth, and in the succession of the night and of the day, are signs for men of understanding heart;  Who standing, and sitting, and reclining, bear God in mind, and muse on the creation of the Heavens and of the Earth
 "O our Lord!" say they, "thou hast not created this in vain
 No
 Glory be to Thee! Keep us, then, from the torment of the fire
  O our Lord! surely thou wilt put him to shame whom thou shalt cause to enter into the Fire, and the wrong-doers shall have none to help them
  O our Lord! we have indeed heard the voice of one that called
 He called us to the faith-’Believe on your Lord’-and we have believed
  O our Lord! forgive us then our sin, and hide away from us our evil deeds, and cause us to die with the righteous
  O our Lord! and give us what thou hast promised us by thine apostles, and put us not to shame on the day of the resurrection
 Verily, Thou wilt not fail thy promise
"  And their Lord answereth them, "I will not suffer the work of him among you that worketh, whether of male or female, to be lost
 The one of you is the issue of the other
57  And they who have fled their country and quitted their homes and suffered in my cause, and have fought and fallen, I will blot out their sins from them, and I will bring them into gardens beneath which the streams do flow
"  A recompense from God! and God! with His is the perfection of recompense!  Let not prosperity in the land58 on the part of those who believe not, deceive thee
 'Tis but a brief enjoyment! Then shall Hell be their abode; and wretched the bed!  But as to those who fear their Lord-for them are the gardens 'neath which the rivers flow: therein shall they abide for aye
 Such their reception with God- and that which is with God is best for the righteous
  Among the people of the Book are those who believe in God, and in what He hath sent down to you, and in what He hath sent down to them, humbling themselves before God
 They barter not the signs of God for a mean price
  These! their recompense awaiteth them with their Lord: aye! God is swift to take account
  O ye who believe! be patient, and vie in patience, and be firm, and fear God, that it may be well with you
   _______________________  1 Verses 1-87 probably belong to the period between the battle of Bedr and Hej
 6
-Muhammad supposed Imran or Amran to be the father of the Virgin Mary (Sura [cix
] lxvi
 12)-Mary and Elizabeth to be sisters; who, with Jesus, John, and Zacharias, make up the family of Imran
 It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Muhammad is guilty of the anachronism of confounding Miriam with the Virgin Mary
 On the other hand is the difficulty of conceiving that as the sequence of time and fact is observed with tolerable accuracy in regard to the main features of Jewish and Christian History, he should have fallen into so serious an error, or have so inadvertently adopted, as Mr
 Muir supposes, the phraseology of his Jewish informants (amongst whom the only well-known Mary (Miriam) was the daughter of Imran and the sister of Moses) as to have overlooked the discrepancy in their respective dates
 But it is possible that Muhammad believed, as some Muslim writers assert, that Miriam's soul and body were miraculously preserved till the time of Jesus in order to become Mary his mother
 Certainly the Talmudists fabled that the Angel of Death and the worm of corruption had no power over Miriam

 The Muhammadans believe that Jesus on his return to earth at the end of the world will slay the Antichrist, die, and be raised again

-14 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ALL that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth praiseth God
 He is the Mighty, the Wise!  Believers! why profess ye that which ye practise not?1  Most hateful is it to God that ye say that which ye do not
  Verily God loveth those who, as though they were a solid wall, do battle for his cause in serried lines!  And bear in mind when Moses said to his people, "Why grieve ye me, O my people, when ye know that I am God's apostle unto you?" And when they went astray, God led their hearts astray; for God guideth not a perverse people:  And remember when Jesus the son of Mary said, "O children of Israel! of a truth I am God's apostle to you to confirm the law which was given before me, and to announce an apostle that shall come after me whose name shall be Ahmad!"2 But when he (Ahmad) presented himself with clear proofs of his mission, they said, "This is manifest sorcery!"  But who more impious than he who when called to Islam deviseth a falsehood concerning God? God guideth not the wicked!  Fain would they put out the light of God with their mouths! but though the Infidels hate it, God will perfect his light
  He it is who hath sent his apostle with guidance and the religion of truth, that, though they hate it who join other gods with God, He may make it victorious over every other religion
  O ye who believe! shall I shew you a merchandise that shall deliver you from the sore torment?  Believe in God and his apostle, and do valiantly in the cause of God with your wealth and with your persons! This, did ye but know it, will be best for you
  Your sins will He forgive you, and He will bring you into gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow-into charming abodes in the gardens of Eden: This shall be the great bliss
-  And other things which ye desire will he bestow, Help from God and speedy conquest!3 Bear thou these tidings to the faithful
  O ye who believe! be helpers (ansars) of God; as said Jesus the son of Mary to his apostles, "Who will come to the help of God?" "We," said the apostles, "will be helpers of God
" And a part of the children of Israel believed, and a part believed not
 But to those who believed gave we the upperhand over their foes, and soon did they prove victorious
   _______________________  1 Addressed to the Muslims who had turned their backs to the enemy at Ohod
  2 Muhammad had no doubt heard that Jesus had promised a Paracletos, John xvi

 This title, understood by him, probably from the similarity of sound, as equivalent to Periclytos, he applied to himself with reference to his own name Muhammad (i
e
 praised, glorified) from the same root and of the same meaning as Ahmad, also one of the Prophet's names
 It may be here remarked that the name Muhammad, if pronounced Muhammed, "might be understood by an Arab in an active instead of a passive sense

 1-16, where the morning, noon, and even are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; John iv
 21; 1 John iv

  3 If this allude to a meditated attack on the Banu Nadir (see Sura [cii

1-29 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ALL that is in the Heavens and in the Earth praiseth God, and He is the Mighty, the Wise!  His the Kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth; He maketh alive and killeth; and He hath power over all things!  He is the first and the last; the Seen and the Hidden;2 and He knoweth all things!  It is He who in six days created the Heavens and the Earth, then ascended His throne
 He knoweth that which entereth the earth, and that which goeth forth from it, and what cometh down from Heaven, and what mounteth up to it; and wherever ye are, He is with you; and God beholdeth all your actions!  His the kingdom of the Heavens and the Earth; and to God shall all things return!  He causeth the night to pass into the day, and He causeth the day to pass into the night: and He knoweth the very secrets of the bosom!  Believe in God and his apostle, and bestow in alms of that whereof God hath made you heirs: for whoever among you believe and give alms-their's shall be a great recompense
  What hath come to you that ye believe not in God, although the apostle exhorteth you to believe in your Lord, and He hath accepted your alliance-if ye are true believers?  He it is who hath sent down clear tokens upon His servant, that He may bring you out of darkness into light; and truly, Kind, Merciful to you is God
  And what hath come to you that ye expend not for the cause of God? since the heritage of the Heavens and of the Earth is God's only! Those among you who contributed before the victory, and fought, shall be differently treated from certain others among you! Such shall have a nobler grade than those who contributed and fought after it
 But a goodly recompense hath God promised to all; and God is fully informed of your actions
  Who is he that will lend a generous loan to God? So will He double it to him, and he shall have a noble reward
  One day thou shalt see the believers, men and women, with their light running before them, and on their right hand
3 The angels shall say to them, "Good tidings for you this day of gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow, in which ye shall abide for ever!" This the great bliss!  On that day the hypocrites, both men and women, shall say to those who believe, "Tarry for us, that we may kindle our light at yours
" It shall be said, "Return ye back, and seek light for yourselves
" But between them shall be set a wall with a gateway, within which shall be the Mercy, and in front, without it, the Torment
 They shall cry to them, "Were we not with you?" They shall say, "Yes! but ye led yourselves into temptation, and ye delayed, and ye doubted, and the good things ye craved deceived you, till the doom of God arrived:-and the deceiver deceived you in regard to God
"  On that day, therefore, no ransom shall be taken from you or from those who believe not:-your abode the fire!-This shall be your master!4 and wretched the journey thither!  Hath not the time come, for those who believe, to humble their hearts at the warning of God and at the truth which he hath sent down? and that they be not as those to whom the Scriptures were given heretofore, whose lifetime was prolonged, but whose hearts were hardened, and many of them were perverse?  Know that God quickeneth the earth after its death! Now have we made these signs clear to you, that ye may understand
  Verily, they who give alms, both men and women, and they who lend a generous loan to God,-doubled shall it be to them-and they shall have a noble recompense
  And they who believed in God and his apostle are the men of truth, and the witnesses in the presence of their Lord;5 They shall have their recompense and their light: But as for the infidels, and those who give the lie to our signs, these shall be the inmates of Hell
  Know ye that this world's life is only a sport, and pastime, and show, and a cause of vainglory among you! And the multiplying of riches and children is like the plants which spring up after rain-Their growth rejoiceth the husband-man; then they wither away, and thou seest them all yellow; then they become stubble
 And in the next life is a severe chastisement,  Or else pardon from God and His satisfaction: and this world's life is but a cheating fruition
6  Vie in hasting after pardon from your Lord, and Paradise-whose outspread is as the outspread of the Heaven and of the Earth: Prepared is it for those who believe in God and His apostles: Such is the bounty of God: to whom He will He giveth it: and of immense bounty is God!  No mischance chanceth either on earth or in your own persons, but ere we created them, it was in the Book;7-for easy is this to God-  Lest ye distress yourselves if good things escape you, and be over joyous for what falleth to your share
 God loveth not the presumptuous, the boaster,  Who are covetous themselves and incite others to covetousness
 But whose turneth away from almsgiving-Ah! God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy
  We have sent our apostles with the clear tokens, and we have caused the Book and the balance8 to descend with them, that men might observe fairness
 And we have sent down IRON
 Dire evil9 resideth in it, as well as advantage, to mankind! God would know who will assist Him and his apostle in secret
 Verily, God is Powerful, Strong
  And of old sent we Noah and Abraham, and on their seed conferred the gift of prophecy, and the Book; and some of them we guided aright; but many were evil doers
  Then we caused our apostles to follow in their footsteps; and we caused Jesus the son of Mary to follow them; and we gave him the Evangel,10 and we put into the hearts of those who followed him kindness and compassion: but as to the monastic life, they invented it themselves
 The desire only of pleasing God did we prescribe to them, and this they observed not as it ought to have been observed: but to such of them as believed gave we their reward, though many of them were perverse
  O ye who believe! fear God and believe in his apostle: two portions of his mercy will He give you
 He will bestow on you light to walk in, and He will forgive you: for God is Forgiving, Merciful;  That the people of the Book may know that they have no control over aught of the favours of God, and that these gifts of grace11 are in the hands of God, and that He vouchsafeth them to whom he will; for God is of immense bounty

-175 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O MEN! fear your Lord, who hath created you of one man (nafs, soul), and of him created his wife, and from these twain hath spread abroad so many men and WOMEN
 And fear ye God, in whose name ye ask mutual favours,-and reverence the wombs that bare you
 Verily is God watching over you!  And give to the orphans their property; substitute not worthless things of your own for their valuable ones, and devour not their property after adding it to your own; for this is a great crime
  And if ye are apprehensive that ye shall not deal fairly with orphans, then, of other women who seem good in your eyes, marry but two, or three, or four;2 and if ye still fear that ye shall not act equitably, then one only; or the slaves whom ye have acquired: this will make justice on your part easier
 Give women their dowry freely; but if of themselves they give up aught thereof to you, then enjoy it as convenient, and profitable:  And entrust not to the incapable the substance which God hath placed with you for their support; but maintain them therewith, and clothe them, and speak to them with kindly speech
  And make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; and if ye perceive in them a sound judgment, then hand over their substance to them; but consume ye it not wastefully, or by hastily entrusting it to them;  Because they are growing up
 And let the rich guardian not even touch it; and let him who is poor use it for his support (eat of it) with discretion
  And when ye make over their substance to them, then take witnesses in their presence: God also maketh a sufficient account
  Men ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave; and women3 a part of what their parents and kindred leave: whether it be little or much, let them have a stated portion
  And when they who are of kin are present at the division, and the orphans and the poor, let them too have a share; and speak to them with kindly speech
  And let those be afraid to wrong the orphans, who, should they leave behind them weakly offspring, would be solicitous on their account
 Let them, therefore, fear God, and let them propose what is right
  Verily they who swallow the substance of the orphan wrongfully, shall swallow down only fire into their bellies, and shall burn in the flame!  With regard to your children, God commandeth you to give the male the portion of two females; and if they be females more than two, then they shall have two-thirds of that which their father hath left: but if she be an only daughter, she shall have the half; and the father and mother of the deceased shall each of them have a sixth part of what he hath left, if he have a child; but if he have no child, and his parents be his heirs, then his mother shall have the third: and if he have brethren, his mother shall have the sixth, after paying the bequests he shall have bequeathed, and his debts
 As to your fathers, or your children, ye know not which of them is the most advantageous to you
 This is the law of God
 Verily, God is Knowing, Wise!  Half of what your wives leave shall be your's, if they have no issue; but if they have issue, then a fourth of what they leave shall be your's, after paying the bequests they shall bequeath, and debts
  And your wives shall have a fourth part of what ye leave, if ye have no issue; but if ye have issue, then they shall have an eighth part of what ye leave, after paying the bequests ye shall bequeath, and debts
  If a man or a woman make a distant relation their heir, and he or she have a brother or a sister, each of these two shall have a sixth; but if there are more than this, then shall they be sharers in a third, after payment of the bequests he shall have bequeathed, and debts,  Without loss to any one
 This is the ordinance of God, and God is Knowing, Gracious!  These are the precepts of God; and whoso obeyeth God and his prophet, him shall God bring into gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow, therein to abide for ever: and this, the great blessedness!  And whoso shall rebel against God and his apostle, and shall break His bounds, him shall God place in the fire to abide therein for ever; and his shall be a shameful torment
  If any of your women be guilty of whoredom, then bring four witnesses against them from among yourselves; and if they bear witness to the fact, shut them up within their houses till death release them,4 or God make some way for them
  And if two men among you commit the same crime, then punish them both; but if they turn and amend, then let them be: for God is He who turneth, Merciful!  With God himself will the repentance of those who have done evil ignorantly, and then turn speedily unto Him, be accepted
 These! God will turn unto them:for God is Knowing, Wise!  But no place of repentance shall there be for those who do evil, until, when death is close to one of them, he saith, "Now verily am I turned to God;" nor to those who die unbelievers
 These! we have made ready for them a grievous torment!  O believers! it is not allowed you to be heirs of your wives against their will; nor to hinder them from marrying, in order to take from them part of the dowry you had given them, unless they have been guilty of undoubted lewdness; but associate kindly with them: for if ye are estranged from them, haply ye are estranged from that in which God hath placed abundant good
  And if ye be desirous to exchange one wife for another, and have given one of them a talent, make no deduction from it
 Would ye take it by slandering her, and with manifest wrong?  How, moreover, could ye take it, when one of you hath gone in unto the other, and they have received from you a strict bond of union?  And marry not women whom your fathers have married: for this is a shame, and hateful, and an evil way: though what is past5 may be allowed
  Forbidden to you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your aunts, both on the father and mother's side, and your nieces on the brother and sister's side, and your foster-mothers, and your foster-sisters, and the mothers of your wives, and your step-daughters who are your wards, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in: (but if ye have not gone in unto them, it shall be no sin in you to marry them;) and the wives of your sons who proceed out of your loins; and ye may not have two sisters; except where it is already done
 Verily, God is Indulgent, Merciful!  Forbidden to you also are married women, except those who are in your hands as slaves: This is the law of God for you
 And it is allowed you, beside this, to seek out wives by means of your wealth, with modest conduct, and without fornication
 And give those with whom ye have cohabited their dowry
 This is the law
 But it shall be no crime in you to make agreements over and above the law
 Verily, God is Knowing, Wise!  And whoever of you is not rich enough to marry free believing women, then let him marry such of your believing maidens as have fallen into your hands as slaves; God well knoweth your faith
 Ye are sprung the one from the other
 Marry them, then, with the leave of their masters, and give them a fair dower: but let them be chaste and free from fornication, and not entertainers of lovers
  If after marriage they commit adultery, then inflict upon them half the penalty enacted for free married women
 This law is for him among you who is afraid of doing wrong:6 but if ye abstain,7 it will be better for you
 And God is Lenient, Merciful
  God desireth to make this known to you, and to guide you into the ways of those who have been before you, and to turn Him unto you in mercy
 And God is Knowing, Wise!  God desireth thus to turn him unto you: but they who follow their own lusts, desire that with great swerving should ye swerve! God desireth to make your burden light: for man hath been created weak
  O believers! devour not each other's substance in mutual frivolities;8 unless there be a trafficking among you by your own consent: and commit not suicide:-of a truth God is merciful to you
  And whoever shall do this maliciously and wrongfully, we will in the end cast him into the fire; for this is easy with God
  If ye avoid the great sins which ye are forbidden, we will blot out your faults, and we will cause you to enter Paradise with honourable entry
  Covet not the gifts by which God hath raised some of you above others
 The men shall have a portion according to their deserts, and the women a portion according to their deserts
 Of God, therefore, ask his gifts
 Verily, God hath knowledge of all things
  To every one have we appointed kindred, as heirs of what parents and relatives, and those with whom ye have joined right hands in contract, leave
 Give therefore, to each their portion
 Verily, God witnesseth all things
  Men are superior to women on account of the qualities with which God hath gifted the one above the other, and on account of the outlay they make from their substance for them
 Virtuous women are obedient, careful, during the husband's absence, because God hath of them been careful
9 But chide those for whose refractoriness ye have cause to fear; remove them into beds apart, and scourage them: but if they are obedient to you, then seek not occasion against them: verily, God is High, Great!  And if ye fear a breach between man and wife, then send a judge chosen from his family, and a judge chosen from her family: if they are desirous of agreement, God will effect a reconciliation between them; verily, God is knowing, apprised of all!  Worship God, and join not aught with Him in worship
 Be good to parents,10 and to kindred, and to orphans, and to the poor, and to a neighbour, whether kinsman or new-comer, and to a fellow traveller, and to the wayfarer, and to the slaves whom your right hands hold; verily, God loveth not the proud, the vain boaster,  Who are niggardly themselves, and bid others be niggards, and hide away what God of his bounty hath given them
 We have made ready a shameful chastisement for the unbelievers,  And for those who bestow their substance in alms to be seen of men, and believe not in God and in the last day
 Whoever hath Satan for his companion, an evil companion hath he!  But what blessedness would be theirs, if they should believe in God and in the last day, and bestow alms out of what God hath vouchsafed them; for God taketh knowledge of them!  God truly will not wrong any one of the weight of a mote; and if there be any good deed, he will repay it doubly; and from his presence shall be given a great recompense
  How! when we shall bring up against them witnesses from all peoples, and when we shall bring thee up as witness against these? On that day they who were Infidels and rebelled against the prophet, shall wish that the earth were levelled with them! But nothing shall they hide from God
  O ye true believers,11 come not to prayer when ye are drunken, but wait till ye can understand what ye utter; nor when ye are polluted, unless ye be travelling on the road, until ye have washed you
 If ye be sick, or on a journey, or have come from the unclean place, or have touched a woman, and ye find not water, then rub pure sand, and bathe your face and your hands with it: verily, God is Lenient, Merciful
  Hast thou not remarked those12 to whom a part of the Scriptures hath been given? Vendors are they of error, and are desirous that ye go astray from the way
 But God knoweth your enemies; and God is a sufficient patron, and God is a sufficient helper!  Among the Jews are those who displace the words of their Scriptures, and say, "We have heard, and we have not obeyed
 Hear thou, but as one that heareth not; and LOOK AT US;"13 perplexing with their tongues, and wounding the Faith by their revilings
  But if they would say, "We have heard, and we obey; hear thou, and REGARD US;" it were better for them, and more right
 But God hath cursed them for their unbelief
 Few only of them are believers!  O ye to whom the Scriptures have been given! believe in what we have sent down confirmatory of the Scripture which is in your hands, ere we efface your features, and twist your head round backward, or curse you as we cursed the sabbath-breakers:14 and the command of God was carried into effect
  Verily, God will not forgive the union of other gods with Himself! But other than this will forgive to whom He pleaseth
 And He who uniteth gods with God hath devised a great wickedness
  Hast thou not marked those who hold themselves to be righteous? But God holdeth righteous whom He will; and they shall not be wronged the husk of a date stone
  Behold how they devise a lie of God! Therein is wickedness manifest enough!  Hast thou not observed those to whom a part of the Scriptures hath been given?15 They believe in Djibt and Thagout, and say of the infidels, "These are guided in a batter path than those who hold the faith
"  These are they whom God hath cursed: and for him whom God hath cursed, thou shalt by on means find a helper
  Shall they have a share in the kingdom who would not bestow on their fellow men even the speck in a date stone?  Envy they other men what God of his bounty hath given them? We gave of old the Scriptures and wisdom to the line of Abraham, and we gave them a grand kingdom:  -Some of them believe on the prophet and some turn aside from him:-the flame of Hell is their sufficing punishment!  Those who disbelieve our signs we will in the end cast into the fire: so oft as their skins shall be well burnt,16 we will change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the torment
 Verily God is Mighty, Wise!  But as for those who have believed, and done the things that are right, we will bring being them into gardens 'neath which the rivers flow therein to abide eternally;-therein shall they have wives of stainless purity: and we will bring them into aye-shadowing shades
  Verily, God enjoineth you to give back your trusts to their owners, and when ye judge between men, to judge with fairness
 Excellent is the practice to which God exhorteth you
 God Heareth, Beholdeth!  O ye who believe! obey God and obey the apostle, and those among you invested with authority; and if in aught ye differ, bring it before God and the apostle, if ye believe in God and in the latter day
 This is the best and fairest way of settlement
  Hast thou not marked those who profess that they believe in what hath been sent down to thee, and what hath been sent down before thee? Fain would they be judged before Thagout, though commanded not to believe in him; and fain would Satan make them wander with wanderings wide of truth
  And when it is said to them, "Accede to that which God hath sent down, and to the apostle," thou seest the hypocrites avert them from thee with utter aversion
  But how, when some misfortune shall fortune them, for their previous handywork? Then will they come to thee, swearing by God, "We desire nothing but to promote good and concord!"  These are they whose hearts God knoweth
 Therefore break off from them, and warn them, speak words that may penetrate their souls
  We have not sent any apostle but to be obeyed, it God so will: but if they, after they have sinned to their own hurt by unbelief, come to thee and ask pardon of God, and the apostle ask pardon for them, they shall surely find that God is He who turneth unto man, Merciful
  And they will not-I swear by thy Lord-they will not believe, until they have set thee up as judge between them on points where they differ
 Then shall they not find in their own minds any difficulty in thy decisions, and shall submit with entire submission
  Had we laid down such a law for them as "Kill yourselves, or abandon your dwellings," but few of them would have done it
 But had they done that to which they were exhorted, better and it been for them, and stronger for the confirmation of their faith
  In that case we had surely given them from ourself a great recompense, and on the straight path should we surely have guided them
  And whoever shall obey God and the Apostle, these shall be with those of the Prophets, and of the Sincere, and of the Martyrs, and of the Just, to whom God hath been gracious
 These are a goodly band!  This is the bounty of God; and in knowledge doth God suffice
  O ye who believe! make use of precautions; and advance in detachments, or , advance in a body
  There is of you who will be a laggard: and if a reverse befall you he saith, "Now hath God dealt graciously with me, since I was not with you in the fight:"  But if a success from God betide you, he will say, as if there had never been any friendship between you and him, "Would I had been with them! a rich prize should I have won!"  Let those then fight on the path of God, who barter this present life for that which is to come; for whoever fighteth on God's path, whether he be slain or conquer, we will in the end give him a great reward
  But what hath come to you that ye fight not on the path of God, and for the weak among men, women and children, who say, "O our Lord! bring us forth from this city17 whose inhabitants are oppressors; give us a champion from thy presence; and give us from thy presence a defender
"  They who believe, fight on the path of God; and they who believe not, fight on the path of Thagout: Fight therefore against the friends of Satan
 Verily craft of Satan shall be powerless!  Hast thou not marked those to whom it was said, "Withhold your hands awhile from war; and observe prayer, and pay the stated alms
" But when war is commanded them, lo! a portion of them fear men as with the fear of God, or with a yet greater fear, and say: "O our Lord! why hast thou commanded us war? Couldst thou not have given us respite till our not distant end?" SAY: Small the fruition of this world; but the next life is the true good for him who feareth God! and ye shall not be wronged so much as the skin of a date stone
  Wherever ye be, death will overtake you-although ye be in lofty towers! If good fortune betide them, they say, "This is from God;" and if evil betide them, they say, "This is from thee
" SAY: All is from God: But what hath come to these people that they are not near to understanding what is told them?  Whatever good betideth thee is from God, and whatever betideth thee of evil is from thyself; and we have sent thee to mankind as an apostle: God is thy sufficing witness
  Whoso obeyeth the Apostle, in so doing obeyeth God: and as to those who turn back from thee, we have not sent thee to be their keeper
  Moreover, they say: "Obedience!" but when they come forth from thy presence, a party of them brood by night over other than thy words; but God writeth down what they brood over: therefore separate thyself from them, and put thou thy trust in God
 is a sufficient protector!  Can they not consider the Koran? Were it from any other than God, they would surely have found in it many contradictions
  And when tidings, either of security or alarm, reach them, they tell them abroad; but if they would report them to the apostle, and to those who are in authority among them, those who desire information would learn it from them
 But for the goodness and mercy of God towards you, ye would have followed Satan except a few!  Fight, therefore, on God's path: lay not burdens on any but thyself; and stir up the faithful
 The might of the infidels haply will god restrain, for God is the stronger in prowess, and the stronger to punish
  He who shall mediate between men for a good purpose shall be the gainer by it
 But he who shall mediate with an evil mediation shall reap the fruit of it
 And God keepeth watch over everything
  If ye are greeted with a greeting, then greet ye with a better greeting, or at least return it: God taketh count of all things
  God! there is no god but He! He will certainly assemble you on the day of resurrection
 There is no doubt of it
 And whose word is more true than God's?  Why are ye two parties on the subject of the hypocrites, when God hath cast them off for their doings? Desire ye to guide those whom god hath led astray? But for him whom God leadeth astray, thou shalt by no means find a pathway
  They desire that ye should be infidels as they are infidels, and that ye should be alike
 Take therefore none of them for friends, till they have fled their homes for the cause of God
 If they turn back, then seize them, and slay them wherever ye find them; but take none of them as friends or helpers,  Except those who shall seek and asylum among your allies, and those who come over to you-their hearts forbidding them to make war on you, or to make war on their own people
 Had God pleased, he would have given them power against you, and they would have made war upon you! But, if they depart from you, and make not war against you and offer you peace, the God alloweth you no occasion against them
  Ye will find others who seek to gain your confidence as well as that of their own people: So oft as they return to sedition, they shall be overthrown in it: But if they leave you not, nor propose terms or peace to you nor withhold their hands, then seize them, and slay them, wherever ye find them
 Over these have we given you undoubted power
  A believer killeth not a believer but by mischance: and whoso killeth a believer by mischance shall be bound to free a believer from slavery; and the blood-money shall be paid to the family of the slain, unless they convert it into alms
 But if the slain believer be of a hostile people, then let him confer freedom on a slave who is a believer; and if he be of a people between whom and yourselves there is an alliance, then let the blood-money be paid to his family, and let him set free a slave who is a believer: and let him who hath not the means, fast two consecutive months
 This is the penance enjoined by God; and God is Knowing, Wise!  But whoever shall kill a believer of set purpose, his recompense shall be hell; for ever shall he abide in it; God shall be wrathful with him, and shall curse him, and shall get ready for him a great torment
  O believers! when ye go forth to the fight for the cause of God, be discerning, and say not to every one who meeteth you with a greeting, "Thou art not a believer"18 in your greed after the chance good things of this present life! With God are abundant spoils
 Such hath been your wont in times past; but god hath been gracious to you
 Be discerning, then, for God well knoweth what ye do
  Those believers who sit at home free from trouble, and those who do valiantly in the cause of God with their substance and their persons, shall not be treated alike
 God hath assigned to those who contend earnestly with their persons and with their substance, a rank above those who sit at home
 Goodly promises hath He made to all
 But God hath assigned to the strenuous a rich recompense, above those who sit still at home,  Rank of his own bestowal, and forgiveness, and mercy; for God is Indulgent, Merciful
  The angels,19 when they took the souls of those who had been unjust to their own weal, demanded, "What hath been your state?"20 They said, "We were the weak ones21 of the earth
" They replied, "Was not God's earth broad enough for you to flee away in?" These! their home shall be Hell, and evil the passage to it-  Except the men and women and children who were not able, through their weakness, to find the means of escape, and were not guided on their way
 These haply God will forgive: for God is Forgiving, Gracious
  Whoever flieth his country for the cause of God, will find in the earth many under like compulsion, and abundant resources; and if any one shall quit his home and fly to God and his apostle, and then death overtake him,-his reward from God is sure: for God is Gracious, Merciful!  And when ye go forth to war in the land, it shall be no crime in you to cut short your prayers,22 if ye fear lest the infidels come upon you; Verily, the infidels are your undoubted enemies!  And when thou, O apostle! shalt be among them, and shalt pray with them, then let a party of them rise up with thee, but let them take their arms; and when they shall have made their prostrations, let them retire to your rear: then let another party that hath not prayed come forward, and let them pray with you; but let them take their precautions and their arms
 Pleased would the infidels be for you to neglect your arms and your baggage, that they might turn upon you at once! And it shall be no crime in you to lay down your arms if rain annoy you, or if ye be sick
 But take your precautions
23 Verily, God hath made ready a shameful torment for the infidels
  And when ye shall have ended the prayer, make mention of God, standing, and sitting, and reclining: and as soon as ye are secure, observe prayer; for to the faithful, prayer is a prescribed duty, and for stated hours
  Slacken not in pursuit of the foe
 If ye suffer, assuredly they suffer also as ye suffer; but ye hope from God for what they cannot hope! And God is Knowing, Wise!  Verily, we have sent down the Book to thee with the truth, thou that mayest judge between men according as God hath given thee insight: But with the deceitful ones dispute not: and implore pardon of God
 Verily, God is Forgiving, Merciful
24  And plead not with us for those who are self-deceivers; for God loveth not him who is deceitful, criminal
  From men they hide themselves; but they cannot hide themselves from God: and when they hold nightly discourses which please Him not, He is with them
 God is round about their doings!  Oh! ye are they who plead in their favour in this present life; but who shall plead with God for them on the day of the resurrection? Who will be the guardian over them?  Yet he who doth evil, or shall have acted against his own weal, and then shall ask pardon of God, will find God Forgiving, Merciful:  And whoever committeth a crime, committeth it to his own hurt
 And God is Knowing, Wise!  And whoever committeth an involuntary fault or a crime, and then layeth it on the innocent, shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and of a manifest crime
  But for the grace and mercy of God upon thee, a party among them had resolved to mislead thee, but they shall only mislead themselves; nor in aught shall they harm thee
 God hath caused the Book and the wisdom to descend upon thee: and what thou knowest not He hath caused thee to know: and the grace of God toward thee hath been great
  In most of their secret talk is nothing good; but only in his who enjoineth almsgiving, or that which is right, or concord among men
 Whoso doth this, out of desire to please God, we will give him at the last a great reward:  But whoso shall sever himself from the prophet after that "the guidance" hath been manifested to him, and shall follow any other path than that of the faithful, we will turn our back on him as he hath turned his back on us, and we will cast him into Hell;-an evil journey thither!  God truly will not forgive the joining other gods with Himself
 Other sins He will forgive to whom He will: but he who joineth gods with God, hath erred with far-gone error
  They call, beside Him, upon mere goddesses! they invoke a rebel Satan!  On them is the malison of God
 For he said, "A portion of thy servants will I surely take, and will lead them astray, and will stir desires within them, and will command them and they shall cut the ears of animals;25 and I will command them, and they shall alter the creation of God
"26 He who taketh Satan rather than God for his patron, is ruined with palpable ruin:  He hath made them promises, and he hath stirred desires within them; but Satan promiseth, only to beguile!  These! their dwelling Hell! no escape shall they find from it!  But they who believe and do the things that are right, we will bring them into gardens beneath which the rivers flow; For ever shall they abide therein
 Truly it is the promise of God: And whose word is more sure than God's?  Not according to your wishes, or the wishes of the people of the Book, shall these things be
 He who doth evil shall be recompensed for it
 Patron or helper, beside God, shall he find none
  But whoso doth the things that are right, whether male or female, and he or she a believer,-these shall enter Paradise, nor shall they be wronged the skin of a date stone
  And who hath a better religion than he who resigneth himself to God, who doth what is good, and followeth the faith of Abraham in all sincerity? And God took Abraham for his friend
  All that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth is God's: and God encompasseth all things!  Moreover, they will consult thee in regard to women: SAY: God hath instructed you about them; and His will is rehearsed to you, in the Book, concerning female orphans to whom ye give not their legal due, and whom ye refuse to marry; also with regard to weak children; and that ye deal with fairness towards orphans
 Ye cannot do a good action, but verily God knoweth it
  And if a wife fear ill usage or aversion on the part of her husband, then shall it be no fault in them if they can agree with mutual agreement, for agreement is best
 Men's souls are prone to avarice; but if ye act kindly and fear God, then, verily, your actions are not unnoticed by God!  And ye will not have it at all in your power to treat your wives alike, even though you fain would do so; but yield not wholly to disinclination, so that ye leave one of them as it were in suspense; if ye come to an understanding, and fear God, then, verily, God is Forgiving, Merciful;  But if they separate, God can compensate both out of His abundance; for God is Vast, Wise;  And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's! We have already enjoined those to whom the Scriptures were given before you, and yourselves, to fear God
 But if ye become unbelievers, yet know that whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's: and God is Rich, Praiseworthy
  All that is in Heaven and all that is in Earth is God's! God is a sufficient protector!  If he pleased, he could cause you to pass away, O mankind! and create others in your stead: for this hath God power
  If any one desire the reward of this world, yet with God is the reward of this world and of the next! And God Heareth, Beholdeth
  O ye who believe! stand fast to justice, when ye bear witness before God, though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, whether the party be rich or poor
 God is nearer than you to both
 Therefore follow not passion, lest ye swerve from truth
 And if ye wrest your testimony or stand aloof, God verily is well aware of what ye do
  O ye who believe! believe in God and his Apostle, and the Book which he hath sent down to his Apostle, and the Book which he hath sent down aforetime
 Whoever believeth not on God and his Angels and his Books and his Apostles, and in the last day, he verily hath erred with far-gone error
  Verily, they who believed, then became unbelievers, then believed, and again became unbelievers, and then increased their unbelief-it is not God who will forgive them or guide them into the way
  Announce27 to the hypocrites that a dolorous torment doth await them
  Those who take the unbelievers for friends besides the faithful-do they seek honour at their hands? Verily, all honour belongeth unto God!  And already hath He sent this down to you in the Book28 "WHEN YE SHALL HEAR THE SIGNS OF GOD THEY SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED BUT SHALL BE MOCKED AT
" Sit ye not therefore with such, until they engage in other discourse; otherwise, ye will become like them
 Verily God will gather the hypocrites and the infidels all together in Hell
  They watch you narrowly
 Then if God grant you a victory, they say, "Are we not with you?" and if the infidels meet with a success, they say to them, "Were we not superior to you: and did we not defend you from those believers?" God shall judge betwixt ye on the day of the resurrection, and God will by no means make a way for the infidels over the believers
  The hypocrites would deceive God, but He will deceive them! When they stand up for prayer, they stand carelessly, to be seen of men, and they remember God but little:  Wavering between the one and the other-belonging neither to these nor those! and by no means shalt thou find a path for him whom God misleadeth
  O believers! take not infidels for friends rather than believers
 Would ye furnish God with clear right to punish you?  Verily the hypocrites shall be in the lowest abyss of the fire: and, by no means shalt thou find a helper for them;  Save for those who turn and amend, and lay fast hold on God, and approve the sincerity of their religion to God; these shall be numbered with the faithful, and God will at last bestow on the faithful a great reward
  Why should God inflict a chastisement upon you, if ye are grateful, and believe? God is Grateful, Wise!  God loveth not that evil be matter of public talk, unless any one hath been wronged: God it is who Heareth, Knoweth!  Whether ye publish what is good, or conceal it, or pardon evil, verily God is Pardoning, Powerful!  Of a truth they who believe not on God and his Apostles, and seek to separate God from his Apostles, and say, "Some we believe, and some we believe not," and desire to take a middle way;  These! they are veritable infidels! and for the infidels have we prepared a shameful punishment
  And they who believe on God and his Apostles, and make no difference between them these! we will bestow on them their reward at last
 God is Gracious, Merciful!  The people of the Book will ask of thee to cause a Book to come down unto them out of Heaven
 But a greater thing than this did they ask of Moses! for they said, "Shew us God plainly!" and for this their wickedness did the fire- storm lay hold on them
 Then took they the calf as the object of their worship, after that our clear tokens had come to them; but we forgave them this, and conferred on Moses undoubted power
  And we uplifted the mountain 29 over them when we made a covenant with them, and we said to them, "Enter the gate adoring:"and we said to them, "Transgress not on the Sabbath," and we received from them a strict covenant
  So, for that they have broken their covenant, and have rejected the signs of God, and have put the prophets to death unjustly, saying the while, "Our hearts are uncircumcised,"-Nay, but God hath sealed them up for their unbelief, so that but few believe
  And for their unbelief,-and for their having spoken against Mary a grievous calumny,-  And for their saying, "Verily we have slain the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, an Apostle of God
" Yet they slew him not, and they crucified him not, but they had only his likeness
30 And they who differed about him were in doubt concerning him: No sure knowledge had they about him, but followed only an opinion, and they did not really slay him, but God took him up to Himself
 And God is Mighty, Wise!  There shall not be one of the people of the Book but shall believe in Him before his death, and in the day of resurrection, He will be a witness against them
  For the wickedness of certain Jews, and because they turn many from the way of God, we have forbidden them goodly viands which had been before allowed them
  And because they have taken usury, though they were forbidden it, and have devoured men's substance in frivolity, we have got ready for the infidels among them a grievous torment
  But their men of solid knowledge, and the believers who believe in that which hath been sent down to thee, and in what hath been sent down before thee, and who observe prayer, and pay the alms of obligation, and believe in God and the latter day,-these! we will give them a great reward
  Verily we have revealed to thee as we revealed to Noah and the Prophets after him, and as we revealed to Abraham, and Ismaël, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon; and to David gave we Psalms
  Of some apostles we have told thee before: of other apostles we have not told thee-And discoursing did God discourse with Moses-  Apostles charged to announce and to warn, that men, after those apostles, might have no plea against God
 And God is Mighty, Wise!  But God is himself witness of what He hath sent down to thee: In His knowledge hath He sent it down to thee
 The angels are also its witnesses: but God is a sufficient witness!  Verily, they who believe not and pervert from the way of God, have indeed erred with error wide of truth
  Verily, those who believe not, and act wrongfully, God will never pardon, and never will he guide them on path,  Than the path to Hell, in which they shall abide for ever! And this is easy for God
  O men! now hath an apostle come to you with truth from your Lord
 Believe then, it will be better for you
 But if ye believe not, then, all that is in the Heavens and the Earth is God's; and God is Knowing, Wise!  O ye people of the Book! overstep not bounds in your religion;31 and of God, speak only truth
 The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is only an apostle of God, and his Word which he conveyed into Mary, and a Spirit32 proceeding from himself
 Believe therefore in God and his apostles, and say not, "Three:" (there is a Trinity)-Forbear-it will be better for you
 God is only one God! Far be it from His glory that He should have a son! His, whatever is in the Heavens, and whatever is in the Earth! And God is a sufficient Guardian
  The Messiah disdaineth not to be a servant of God, nor do the angels who are nigh unto Him
  And whoso disdaineth His service, and is filled with pride, God will gather them all to Himself
  And to those who believe and do the things that are right, will He pay them their due recompense, and out of His bounty will He increase them: but as for those who are disdainful and proud, with a grievous chastisement will He chastise them;  And none beside God shall they find to protect or to help them
  O men! now hath a proof come to you from your Lord, and we have sent down to you a clear light
 As to those who believe in God and lay fast hold on Him, these will He cause to enter into his mercy and grace, and along the straight way unto Himself will He guide them
  They will consult thee
 SAY: God instructeth you as to distant kindred
 If a man die childless, but have a sister, half what he shall have shall be her's; and if she die childless he shall be her heir
 But if there be two sisters, two-third parts of what he shall have shall be theirs; and if there be both brothers and sisters, the male shall have the portion of two females
 God teacheth you plainly, that ye err not! God knoweth all things

-DIVORCE1 [CI
]  MECCA
-12 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O PROPHET! when ye divorce women, divorce them at their special times
 And reckon those times exactly, and fear God your Lord
 Put them not forth from their houses, nor allow them to depart, unless they have committed a proven adultery
 This is the precept of God; and whoso transgresseth the precept of God, assuredly imperilleth his own self
 Thou knowest not whether, after this, God may not cause something new to occur which may bring you together again
  And when they have reached their set time, then either keep them with kindness, or in kindness part from them
 And take upright witnesses from among you, and bear witness as unto God
 This is a caution for him who believeth in God and in the latter day
 And whoso feareth God, to him will He grant a prosperous issue, and will provide for him whence he reckoned not upon it
  And for him who putteth his trust in Him will God be all-sufficient
 God truly will attain his purpose
 For everything hath God assigned a period
  As to such of your wives as have no hope of the recurrence of their times, if ye have doubts in regard to them, then reckon three months, and let the same be the term of those who have not yet had them
 And as to those who are with child, their period shall be until they are delivered of their burden
 God will make His command easy to him who feareth Him
  This is God's command which He hath sent down to you: Whoso feareth God, his evil deeds will He cancel and will increase his reward
  Lodge the divorced wherever ye lodge, according to your means; and distress them not by putting them to straits
 And if they are pregnant, then be at charges for the them till they are delivered of their burden; and if they suckle your children, then pay them their hire and consult among yourselves, and act generously: And if herin ye meet with obstacles, then let another female suckle for him
  Let him who hath abundance of his abundance; let him, too, whose store is scanty, give of what God hath vouchsafed to him
 God imposeth burdens only according to the means which He hath given
 God will cause ease to succeed difficulties
  How many cities have turned aside from the command of their Lord and of his apostles! Therefore did we reckon with them in a severe reckoning, and chastised them with a stern chastisement;  And they tasted the harmfulness of their own conduct: and the end of their conduct was ruin
  A vehement chastisement hath God prepared for them! Fear God, then, O ye men of understanding!2  Believers! Now hath God sent down to you a warning! a prophet, who reciteth to you the clear signs of God, that he may bring those who believe, and do the things that are right, out of the darkness into the light
 And-whoso believeth in God, and doeth the things that are right, God will cause them to enter the gardens beneath which the rivers flow, to remain therein for aye! A goodly provision now hath God made for him
  It is God who hath created seven heavens and as many earths

-THE EMIGRATION [CII
]  MEDINA
-24 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  ALL that is in the Heavens and all that is on the Earth praiseth God! He, the Mighty, the Wise!  He it is who caused the unbelievers among the people of the Book to quit their homes and join those who had EMIGRATED previously
1 Ye did not think that they would quit them; and they on their part thought that their fortresses would protect them against God: But God came upon them whence they looked not for Him, and cast such fear into their hearts that by their own hands as well as by the hands of the victorious believers they demolished their houses! Profit by this example ye who are men of insight!  And were it not that God had decreed their exile, surely in this world would he have chastised them: but in the world to come the chastisement of the fire awaiteth them
  This because they set them against God and his apostle; and whoso setteth him against God
 
 
 
 ! God truly is vehement in punishing
  Your cutting down some of their palm trees and sparing others was by God's permission, and to put the wicked to shame
  After the spoils of these Jews which God hath assigned to his apostle, ye pressed not with horse or camel
2 But God giveth his apostles power over what he will
 God is Almighty
  The spoil taken from the people of the towns and assigned by God to his apostle, belongeth to God, and to the apostle, and to his kindred, and to the orphan, and to the poor, and to the wayfarer, that none of it may circulate among such of you only as are rich: What the apostle hath given you, take: What he hath refused you, refuse: And fear ye God, for God is severe in punishing
  To the poor refugees (Mohadjerin) also doth a part belong, who have been driven from their homes and their substance, and who seek favour from God and his goodwill, and aid God and his apostle
 These are the men of genuine virtue
  They of Medina who had been in possession of their abodes and embraced the faith before them, cherish those who take refuge with them; and they find not in their breasts any desire for what hath fallen to their share: they prefer them before themselves, though poverty be their own lot
 And with such as are preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well
  And they who have come after them into the faith say, "O our Lord! forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in the faith, and put not into our hearts ill-will against those who believe
 O our Lord! thou verily art Kind, Merciful
"  Hast thou not observed the disaffected saying to their unbelieving brethren3 among the people of the Book, "If ye be driven forth, we will go forth with you; and in what concerneth you, never will we obey any one; and if ye be attacked we will certainly come to your help
" But God is witness that they are liars
  No! if they were driven forth, they would not share their banishment; if they were attacked they would not help them, or if they help them they will surely turn their backs: then would they remain unhelped
  Assuredly the fear of you is more intense in their hearts than the fear of God! This because they are a people devoid of discernment
  They (the Jews) will not fight against you in a body except in fenced towns or from behind walls
 Mighty is their valour among themselves! thou thinkest them united-but their hearts are divided
 This for that they are a people who understand not
  They act like those who lately preceded them,4 who also tasted the result of their doings; and a grievous chastisement awaiteth them-  Like Satan when he saith to a man, "Be an infidel:" and when he hath become an infidel, he saith, "I share not thy guilt:5 verily, I fear God the Lord of the Worlds
"  Of both, therefore, shall the end be that they dwell for ever in the fire: This is the recompense of the evil doers
  O ye who believe! fear God
 And let every soul look well to what it sendeth on before for the morrow
 And fear ye God: Verily, God is cognisant of what ye do
  And be ye not like those who forget God, and whom He hath therefore caused to forget their proper selves
 Such men are the evil doers
  The inmates of the Fire and the inmates of Paradise are not to be held equal
 The inmates of Paradise only shall be the blissful
  Had we sent down this Koran on some mountain, thou wouldst certainly have seen it humbling itself6 and cleaving asunder for the fear of God
 Such are the parables we propose to men in order that they may reflect
  He is God beside whom there is no god
 He knoweth things visible and invisible: He is the Compassionate, the Merciful
  He is God beside whom there is no god: He is the King, the Holy, the Peaceful, the Faithful, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Strong, the Most High! Far be the Glory of God from that which they unite with Him!  He is God, the Producer, the Maker, the Fashioner! To Him are ascribed excellent titles
 Whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth praiseth Him
 He is the Mighty, the Wise!   _______________________  1 The Jews of Nadhir, three miles from Medina, had broken a treaty made with Muhammad, and in the month RabŒ of the fourth year of the Hejira were besieged by him and driven first to the Jews of Kainoka, who had emigrated previously, under compulsion, after the battle of Bedr, and subsequently out of Arabia

   SURA XXXIII
-THE CONFEDERATES1 [CIII
]  MEDINA
-73 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O PROPHET, fear thou God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites;- Truly God is Knowing, Wise:  But follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord: Cognisant truly is He of all your actions-  And put thou thy trust in God, for a sufficient guardian is God
  God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made your wives whom ye divorce2 to be as your mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons to be as your own sons
 Such words are indeed in your mouths; but God speaketh the truth, and in the right way He guideth
  Name them after their fathers: this will be more right before God
 But if ye know not who their fathers are, then let them be your brethren in the faith, and your comrades
 And unless made with intent of heart, mistakes in this matter shall be no crime in you: for God is Lenient, Merciful
  Nearer of kin to the faithful is the Prophet, than they are to their own selves
 His wives are their mothers
 According to the Book of God, they who are related by blood, are nearer the one to the other than other believers, and than those who have fled their country3 for the cause of God: but whatever kindness ye shew to your kindred, shall be noted down in the Book
  And remember that we have entered into covenant with the Prophets, and with thee, and with Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, Son of Mary: and we formed with them a strict covenant,  That God may question the men of truth as to their truth
4 But a sore torment hath He prepared for the unbelievers
  O believers!5 remember the goodness of God towards you, when the armies came against you, and we sent against them a blast, and hosts that ye saw not; for the eye of God was upon your doings:  When they assailed you from above you, and from below you,6 and when your eyes became distracted, and your hearts came up into your throat, and ye thought divers thoughts of God:  Then were the faithful tried, and with strong quaking did they quake:  And when the disaffected and the diseased7 of heart said, "God and his Apostle have made us but a cheating promise:"  And when a party of them said, "O people of Yathrib!8 there is no place of safety for you here;9 therefore return into the city
" And another party of you asked the prophet's leave to return, saying, "Our houses are left defenceless
" No! they were not left defenceless: but their sole thought was to flee away
  If the enemy had effected an entry at all points, and they (the disaffected) had been asked to promote confusion, they would have done so; but only a short time would they have remained in it
-(Medina)
10  They had before pledged themselves to God that they would not turn their backs; and a pledge given to God must be enquired of
  SAY: Flight shall not profit you; if ye have fled the death or the slaughter, yet even then, but a little while shall ye enjoy your good things!  SAY: Who is he that will screen you from God, whether He choose to bring evil on you, or to shew you mercy? None beside God shall they find to be their patron or helper
  God well knoweth those among you who cause hindrances, and those who say to their brethren, "Come hither to us;" and who come not to the fight except a little
  It is out of covetousness in your regard: for when an alarm cometh, thou mayest see them look to thee, and roll their eyes like him on whom the shadows of death have fallen! Yet, when the alarm is passed, with sharp tongues will they assail you, covetous of the best of the spoil
 No faith have these! God will make their doings of no avail! And easy is this with God
  They thought that the CONFEDERATES would never retire:11 and were the confederates to come again, they would fain be dwelling among the Arabs of the desert, and there ask news about you! for though they were with you, they fought not except a little
  A noble pattern had ye in God's Apostle, for all who hope in God, and in the latter day, and oft remember God!  And when the faithful saw the confederates, they said, "This is what God and His Apostle promised us,12 and God and His Apostle spoke truly:" and it only increased their faith and self-devotion
  Some were there among the faithful who made good what they had promised to God
 Some have fulfilled their course, and others await its fulfilment, and have not been changelings who change-  That God may reward the faithful for their faithfulness, and may punish the hypocrites, if He so please, or be turned unto them: for God is Forgiving, Merciful
  And God drove back the infidels in their wrath; they won no advantage; God sufficed the faithful in the fight: for God is Strong, Mighty!  And He caused those of the people of the Book (the Jews), who had aided the confederates, to come down out of their fortresses, and cast dismay into their hearts: some ye slew, others ye took prisoners
13  And He gave you their land, and their dwellings, and their wealth, for an heritage-even a land on which ye had never set foot: for the might of God is equal to all things
  O Prophet! say to thy wives,14 If ye desire this present life and its braveries, come then, I will provide for you, and dismiss you with an honourable dismissal
  But if ye desire God and His Apostle, and a home in the next life, then, truly, hath God prepared for those of you who are virtuous, a great reward
  O wives of the Prophet! should any of you be guilty of a proven lewdness, doubly shall her chastisement be doubled: and with God this is easy
  But whoever of you shall obey God and His Apostle, and shall do that which is right, twice over will we give her her reward, and we have prepared for her a noble provision
  O wives of the Prophet! ye are not as other women
 If ye fear God, be not too complaisant of speech, lest the man of unhealthy heart should lust after you, but speak with discreet speech
  And abide still in your houses, and go not in public decked as in the days of your former ignorance,15 but observe prayer, and pay the impost, and obey God and the Apostle: for God only desireth to put away filthiness from you16 as his household, and with cleansing to cleanse you
  And recollect what is rehearsed to you in your houses of the Book of God, and of wisdom: for God is keen-sighted, cognisant of all
  Truly the men who resign themselves to God (Muslims), and the women who resign themselves, and the believing men and the believing women, and the devout men and the devout women, and the men of truth, and the women of truth, and the patient men and the patient women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the men who give alms and the women who give alms, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the chaste men and the chaste women, and the men and the women who oft remember God: for them hath God prepared forgiveness and a rich recompense
  And it is not for a believer, man or woman, to have any choice in their affairs, when God and His Apostle have decreed a matter: and whoever disobeyeth God and His Apostle, erreth with palpable error
  And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God had shewn favour,17 and to whom thou also hadst shewn favour, "Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;" and thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light
18 and thou didst fear man; but more right had it been to fear God
 And when Zaid had settled concerning her to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have settled the affair concerning them
 And the behest of God is to be performed
  No blame attacheth to the prophet where God hath given him a permission
 Such was the way of God with those prophets who flourished before thee; for God's behest is a fixed decree-  Who fulfilled the mission with which God had charged them,19 and feared Him, and feared none but God
 And God taketh a sufficient account
  Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Apostle of God, and the seal of the prophets: and God knoweth all things
  O Believers! remember God with frequent remembrance, and praise Him morning and evening
  He blesseth you, and His angels intercede for you, that He may bring you forth out of darkness into light: and Merciful is He to the Believers
  Their greeting on the day when they shall meet Him shall be "Peace!" And He hath got ready for them a noble recompense
  O Prophet ! we have sent thee to be a witness, and a herald of glad tidings, and a warner;  And one who, through His own permission, summoneth to God, and a light-giving torch
  Announce, therefore, to believers, that great boons do await them from God;  And obey not the Infidels and Hypocrites-yet abstain from injuring them: and put thou thy trust in God, for God is a sufficient guardian
  O Believers! when ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have consummated the marriage, ye have no term prescribed you, which ye must fulfil towards them: provide for them, and dismiss them with a reputable dismissal
  O Prophet! we allow thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered, and the slaves whom thy right hand possesseth out of the booty which God hath granted thee, and the daughters of thy uncle, and of thy paternal and maternal aunts who fled with thee to Medina, and any believing woman who hath given herself up to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to wed her-a Privilege for thee above the rest of the Faithful
  We well know what we have settled for them, in regard to their wives and to the slaves whom their right hands hold, that there may be no fault on thy part:20 and God is Indulgent, Merciful!  Thou mayst decline for the present whom thou wilt of them, and thou mayest take to thy bed her whom thou wilt, and whomsoever thou shalt long for of those thou shalt have before neglected; and this shall not be a crime in thee
 Thus will it be easier to give them the desire of their eyes, and not to put them to grief, and to satisfy them with what thou shalt accord to each of them
 God knoweth what is in your hearts, and God is Knowing, Gracious
  It is not permitted thee to take other wives hereafter,21 nor to change thy present wives for other women, though their beauty charm thee, except slaves whom thy right hand shall possess
22 And God watcheth all things
  O Believers! enter not into the houses of the Prophet,23 save by his leave, for a meal, without waiting his time
 When ye are invited then enter, and when ye have eaten then disperse at once
24 And engage not in familiar talk, for this would cause the Prophet trouble, and he would be ashamed to bid you go; but God is not ashamed to say the truth
 And when ye would ask any gift of his wives, ask it from behind a veil
 Purer will this be for your hearts and for their hearts
 And ye must not trouble the Apostle of God, nor marry his wives, after him, for ever
 This would be a grave offence with God
  Whether ye bring a matter to the light or hide it, God truly hath knowledge of all things
  No blame shall attach to them (your wives) for speaking to their fathers unveiled, or to their sons, or to their brothers, or to their brothers' sons, or to their sisters' sons, or to their women, or to the slaves whom their right hands hold
 And fear ye God: for God witnesseth all things
  Verily, God and His Angels bless the Prophet! Bless ye Him, O Believers, and salute Him with salutations of Peace
  Verily, they who affront God and His Apostle, the curse of God is on them in this world, and in the world to come: and He hath prepared for them a shameful chastisement
  And they who shall affront believing men and believing women, for no fault of theirs, they shall surely bear the guilt of slander, and of a clear wrong
  O Prophet! speak to thy wives and to thy daughters,25 and to the wives of the Faithful, that they let their veils fall low
 Thus will they more easily be known, and they will not be affronted
 God is Indulgent, Merciful!  If the Hypocrites, and the men of tainted heart, and the stirrers of sedition in Medina desist not, we will surely stir thee up against them
 Then shall they not be suffered to dwell near thee therein, but a little while:  Cursed wherever they are found; they shall be seized and slain with slaughter!  Such hath been the way of God with those who lived before them; and no change canst thou find in the way of God
  Men will ask thee of "the Hour
" SAY: The knowledge of it is with God alone: and who can tell thee whether haply the Hour be not nigh at hand?  Verily, God hath cursed the Infidels, and hath got ready for them the flame:  For aye shall they abide therein; none to befriend them, no helper shall they find!  On the day when their faces shall be rolled in the fire, they shall cry: "Oh! would that we had obeyed God, and obeyed the Apostle!"  And they shall say: "Oh our Lord! indeed we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us from the way of God-  O our Lord! give them a double chastisement, and curse them with a heavy curse
"  O Believers! be not like those who affronted Moses
26 But God cleared him from what they said of him, and of God was he highly esteemed
  O Believers! fear God, and speak with well-guided speech
  That God may bless your doings for you, and forgive you your sins
 And whoso obeyeth God and His Apostle with great bliss shall be blessed
  Verily, we proposed to the Heavens, and to the Earth, and to the Mountains to receive the Faith, but they refused the burden, and they feared to receive it
 Man undertook to bear it, but hath proved unjust, senseless!  Therefore will God punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the men and the women who join gods with God; but to the believing men and women will God turn him: for God is Indulgent, Merciful!   _______________________  1 Medina was besieged, when this Sura was revealed, by certain confederate tribes at the instigation of the Jews, an

-11 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  WHEN the Hypocrites come to thee, they say, "We bear witness that thou art the Sent One of God
" God knoweth that thou art His Sent One: but God beareth witness that the HYPOCRITES do surely lie
  Their faith2 have they used as a cloak, and they turn aside others from the way of God! Evil are all their doings
  This, for that they believed, then became unbelievers!Therefore hath a seal been set upon their hearts, and they understand not
  When thou seest them, their persons make thee marvel; and if they speak, thou listenest with pleasure to their discourse
 Like timbers are they leaning against a wall!3 They think that every shout is against them
 They are enemies-Beware of them then-God do battle with them! How false are they!  And when it is said to them, "Come, the Apostle of God will ask pardon for you," they turn their heads aside, and thou seest them withdraw in their pride
  Alike shall it be to them whether thou ask forgiveness for them, or ask it not
 By no means will God forgive them: God hath no guidance for a perverse people
  These are they who say to you of Medina, "Spend not aught upon those who are with the Apostle of God, and they will be forced to quit him
" Yet the treasures of the Heavens and of the Earth are God's! But the Hypocrites have no understanding
  They say: "If we return to the city, the mightier will assuredly drive out the weaker from it
" But might is with God, and with the Apostle, and with the Faithful! Yet the Hypocrites understand not
  O ye who believe! let not your wealth and your children delude you into forgetfulness of God
 Whoever shall act thus, shall surely suffer loss
  And expend in the cause of God out of that with which we have supplied you, ere death surprise each one of you, and he say, "O Lord! wilt thou not respite me to a term not far distant, that I may give alms, and become one of the just?"  And by no means will God respite a soul when its hour hath come! And God is fully cognisant of what ye do

-64 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  A SURA which we have sent down and sanctioned! Clear signs have we sent down therein, that ye may take warning
  The whore and the whoremonger-scourge each of them with an hundred stripes; and let not compassion keep you from carrying out the sentence of God, if ye believe in God and the last day: And let some of the faithful witness their chastisement
1  The whoremonger shall not marry other than a whore or an idolatress; and the whore shall not marry other than a whoremonger or an idolater
 Such alliances are forbidden to the faithful
  They who defame virtuous women,2 and bring not four witnesses, scourge them with fourscore stripes, and receive ye not their testimony for ever, for these are perverse persons-  Save those who afterwards repent and live virtuously; for truly God is Lenient, Merciful!  And they who shall accuse their wives, and have no witnesses but themselves, the testimony of each of them shall be a testimony by God four times repeated, that he is indeed of them that speak the truth
3  And the fifth time that the malison of God be upon him, if he be of them that lie
  But it shall avert the chastisement from her if she testify a testimony four times repeated, by God, that he is of them that lie;  And a fifth time to call down the wrath of God on her, if he have spoken the truth
  And but for the goodness and mercy of God towards you, and that God is He who loveth to turn, Wise 
 
 
 
 !  Of a truth, they who advanced that lie4 were a large number of you; but regard it not as an evil to you
 No, it is an advantage to you
5 To every man among them shall it be done according to the offence he hath committed; and as to that person6 among them who took on himself to aggravate it, a sore punishment doth await him
  Did not the faithful of both sexes, when ye heard of this, form a favourable judgment in their own minds, and say,  "This is a manifest lie?"  Have they brought four witnesses of the fact? If they cannot produce the witnesses, they are the liars in the sight of God
  And but for the goodness of God towards you, and His mercy in this world and in the next, a severe punishment had come upon you for that which ye spread abroad, when ye uttered with your tongues, and spake with your mouths that of which ye had no knowledge
 Ye deemed it to be a light matter, but with God it was a grave one
  And did ye say when ye heard it, "It is not for us to talk of this affair! O God! By thy Glory, this is a gross calumny?"  God hath warned you that ye go not back to the like of this for ever, if ye be believers:  And God maketh His signs clear to you: for God is Knowing, Wise
  But as for those who love that foul calumnies should go forth against those who believe, a grievous chastisement awaits them  In this world and in the next
 And God hath knowledge, but ye have not
  And but for the goodness of God towards you and His Mercy, and that God is Kind, Merciful 
 
 
 !  O ye who believe! follow not the steps of Satan, for whosoever shall follow the steps of Satan, he will enjoin on him what is base and blameworthy; and but for the goodness of God towards you,7 and His mercy, no one of you had been cleansed for ever: but God maketh whom He will to be clean, and God Heareth, Knoweth
  And let not persons of wealth and means among you swear that they will not give to their kindred, to the poor, and to those who have fled their homes in the cause of God; let them rather pardon and pass over the offence
8 Desire ye not that God should forgive you? And God is Gracious, Merciful!  Verily, they who throw out charges against virtuous but careless women, who yet are believers, shall be cursed in this world and in the world to come; and a terrible punishment doth await them
  Their own tongues, and hands, and feet, shall one day bear witness against them of their own doings
9  On that day will God pay them their just due, and they shall know that God is the clear Truth itself
  Bad women for bad men, and bad men for bad women; but virtuous women for virtuous men, and virtuous men for virtuous women! These shall be cleared from calumnies; theirs shall be forgiveness and an honourable provision
  O ye who believe! enter not into other houses10 than your own, until ye have asked leave, and have saluted its inmates
 This will be best for you: haply ye will bear this in mind
  And if ye find no one therein, then enter it not till leave be given you; and if it be said to you, "Go ye back," then go ye back
 This will be more blameless in you, and God knoweth what ye do
  There shall be no harm in your entering houses in which no one dwelleth, for the supply of your needs: and God knoweth what ye do openly and what ye hide
  Speak unto the believers that they restrain their eyes and observe continence
 Thus will they be more pure
 God is well aware of what they do
  And speak to the believing women that they refrain their eyes, and observe continence; and that they display not their ornaments, except those which are external; and that they throw their veils over their bosoms, and display not their ornaments, except to their husbands or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male domestics who have no natural force, or to children who note not women's nakedness
 And let them not strike their feet together, so as to discover their hidden ornaments
11 And be ye all turned to God, O ye Believers! that it may be well with you
  And marry those among you who are single, and your good servants, and the handmaidens
 If they are poor, God of His bounty will enrich them
 God is all-bounteous, Knowing
  And let those who cannot find a match12 live in continence till God of His bounty shall enrich them
 And to those of your slaves who desire a deed of manumission, execute it for them, if ye know good in them, and give them a portion of the wealth of God which He hath given you
13 Force not your female slaves into sin, in order that ye may gain the casual fruitions of this world, if they wish to preserve their modesty
 Yet if any one compel them, then Verily to them, after their compulsion, will God be Forgiving, Merciful
  And now have we sent down to you clear signs, and an instance from among those who flourished before you, and a caution for the God-fearing
14  God is the LIGHT of the Heavens and of the Earth
 His Light is like a niche in which is a lamp-the lamp encased in glass-the glass, as it were, a glistening star
 From a blessed tree is it lighted, the olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would well nigh shine out, even though fire touched it not! It is light upon light
 God guideth whom He will to His light, and God setteth forth parables to men, for God knoweth all things
  In the temples which God hath allowed to be reared, that His name may therein be remembered, do men praise Him morn and even
  Men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of God, and from the observance of prayer, and the payment of the stated alms, through fear of the day when hearts shall throb and eyes shall roll:  That for their most excellent works may God recompense them, and of His bounty increase it to them more and more: for God maketh provision for whom He pleaseth without measure
  But as to the infidels, their works are like the vapour in a plain which the thirsty dreameth to be water, until when he cometh unto it, he findeth it not aught, but findeth that God is with him; and He fully payeth him his account: for swift to take account is God:  Or like the darkness on the deep sea when covered by billows riding upon billows, above which are clouds: darkness upon darkness
 When a man reacheth forth his hand, he cannot nearly see it! He to whom God shall not give light, no light at all hath he!  Hast thou not seen how all in the Heavens and in the Earth uttereth the praise of God?-the very birds as they spread their wings? Every creature knoweth its prayer and its praise! and God knoweth what they do
  God's, the Kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth: and unto God the final return!  Hast thou not seen that God driveth clouds lightly forward, then gathereth them together, then pileth them in masses? And then thou seest the rain forthcoming from their midst; and He causeth clouds like mountains charged with hail, to descend from the heaven, and He maketh it to fall on whom He will, and from whom He will He turneth it aside
-The brightness of His lightning all but taketh away the sight!  God causeth the day and the night to take their turn
 Verily in this is teaching for men of insight
 And God hath created every animal of water
15 Some go upon the belly; some go upon two feet; some go upon four feet
 God hath created what He pleased
 Aye, God hath power over all things
  Now have we sent down distinct signs
-And God guideth whom He will into the right path:  For there are who say "We believe on God and on the Apostle, and we obey;" yet, after this, a part of them turn back
16 But these are not of the faithful
  And when they are summoned before God and His Apostle that He may judge between them, lo! a part of them withdraw:  But had the truth been on their side, they would have come to Him, obedient
  What! are they diseased of heart? Do they doubt? Are they afraid that God and His Apostles will deal unfairly with them? Nay, themselves are the unjust doers
  The words of the believers, when called to God and His Apostle that He may judge between them, are only to say, "We have heard, and we obey:" these are they with whom it shall be well
  And whoso shall obey God, and His Apostle, and shall dread God and fear Him, these are they that shall be the blissful
  And they have sworn by God, with a most solemn oath, that if thou give them the word, they will certainly march forth
 Say: swear ye not: of more worth is obedience
 Verily, God is well aware of what ye do
  SAY: Obey God and obey the Apostle
 Suppose that ye turn back, still the burden of his duty is on him only, and the burden of your duty rests on you
 If ye obey Him, ye shall have guidance: but plain preaching is all that devolves upon the Apostle
  God hath promised to those of you who believe and do the things that are right, that He will cause them to succeed others in the land, as He gave succession to those who were before them, and that He will establish for them that religion which they delight in, and that after their fears He will give them security in exchange
 They shall worship Me: nought shall they join with Me: And whoso, after this, believe not, they will be the impious
  But observe prayer, and pay the stated alms, and obey the Apostle, that haply ye may find mercy
  Let not the Infidels think that they can weaken God on His own Earth: their dwelling place shall be the Fire! and right wretched the journey!  O ye who believe! let your slaves, and those of you who have not come of age, ask leave of you, three times a day, ere they come into your presence;-before the morning prayer, and when ye lay aside your garments at mid-day, and after the evening prayer
 These are your three times of privacy
 No blame shall attach to you or to them, if after these times, when ye go your rounds of attendance on one another, they come in without permission
 Thus doth God make clear to you His signs: and God is Knowing, Wise!  And when your children come of age, let them ask leave to come into your presence, as they who were before them asked it
 Thus doth God make clear to you his signs: and God is Knowing, Wise
  As to women who are past childbearing, and have no hope of marriage, no blame shall attach to them if they lay aside their outer garments, but so as not to shew their ornaments
 Yet if they abstain from this, it will be better for them: and God Heareth, Knoweth
  No crime17 shall it be in the blind, or in the lame, or in the sick, to eat at your tables: or in yourselves, if ye eat in your own houses, or in the houses of your fathers, or of your mothers, or of your brothers, or of your sisters, or of your uncles on the father's side, or of your aunts on the father's side, or of your uncles on the mother's side, or of your aunts on the mother's side, or in those of which ye possess the keys, or in the house of your friend
 No blame shall attach to you whether ye eat together or apart
  And when ye enter houses, salute one another with a good and blessed greeting as from God
 Thus doth God make clear to you His signs, that haply ye may comprehend them
  Verily, they only are believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and who, when they are with him upon any affair of common interest, depart not until they have sought his leave
 Yes, they who ask leave of thee, are those who believe in God and His Apostle
 And when they ask leave of Thee on account of any affairs of their own, then grant it to those of them whom thou wilt, and ask indulgence for them of God: for God is Indulgent, Merciful
  Address not the Apostle as ye address one another
18 God knoweth those of you who withdraw quietly from the assemblies, screening themselves behind others
 And let those who transgress his command beware, lest some present trouble befall them, or a grievous chastisement befall them, hereafter
  Is not whatever is in the Heavens and the Earth God's? He knoweth your state; and one day shall men be assembled before Him, and He will tell them of what they have done: for God knoweth all things

-SHE WHO PLEADED [CVI
]  MEDINA
-22 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  God hath heard the words of HER1 WHO PLEADED with thee against her husband, and made her plaint to God; and God hath heard your mutual intercourse: for God Heareth, Beholdeth
  As to those of you who put away their wives by saying, "Be thou to me as my mother's back" their mothers2 they are not; they only are their mothers who gave them birth! they certainly say a blameworthy thing and an untruth:  But truly, God is Forgiving, Indulgent
  And those who thus put away their wives, and afterwards would recall their words, must free a captive before they can come together again
 To this are ye warned to conform: and God is aware of what ye do
  And he who findeth not a captive to set free, shall fast two months in succession before they two come together
 And he who shall not be able to do so, shall feed sixty poor men
 This, that he may believe in God and His Apostle
 These are the statutes of God: and for the unbelievers is an afflictive chastisement!  Truly they who oppose God and His Apostle shall be brought low, as those who were before them were brought low
 And now have we sent down demonstrative signs: and, for the Infidels is a shameful chastisement
  On the day when God shall raise them all to life, and shall tell them of their doings
 God hath taken count of them, though they have forgotten them! and God is witness over all things
  Dost thou not see that God knoweth all that is in the Heavens and all that is in the Earth? Three persons speak not privately together, but He is their fourth; nor five, but He is their sixth; nor fewer nor more, but wherever they be He is with them
 Then on the day of resurrection He will tell them of their deeds: for God knoweth all things
  Hast thou not marked those who have been forbidden secret talk, and return to what they have been forbidden, and talk privately together with wickedness, and hate, and disobedience towards the Apostle? And when they come to thee, they greet thee not as God greeteth thee:3 and they say among themselves, "Why doth not God punish us for what we say?" Hell shall be their meed:4 they shall be burned at its fire: and a wretched passage thither!  O Believers! when ye hold private converse together, let it not be with wickedness, and hate, and disobedience towards the Apostle; but let your private talk be with justice and the fear of God: aye, fear ye God unto whom ye shall be gathered!  Only of Satan is this clandestine talk, that he may bring the faithful to grief: but, unless by God's permission, not aught shall he harm them! in God then let the faithful trust
  O ye who believe! when it is said to you, "Make room in your assemblies," then make ye room
 God will make room for you in Paradise! And when it is said to you, "Rise up," then rise ye up
 God will uplift those of you who believe, and those to whom "the Knowledge" is given, to lofty grades! and God is cognisant of your actions
  O ye who believe! when ye go to confer in private with the Apostle, give alms before such conference
 Better will this be for you, and more pure
 But if ye have not the means, then truly God is Lenient, Merciful
  Do ye hesitate to give alms previously to your private conference? Then if ye do it not (and God will excuse it in you), at least observe prayer, and pay the stated impost, and obey God and His Apostle: for God is cognisant of your actions
  Hast thou not remarked those who make friends of that people with whom God is angered? They are neither of your party nor of theirs; and they swear to a lie,5 knowing it to be such
  God hath got ready for them a severe torment: for, evil is that they do
  They make a cloak of their faith, and turn others aside from the way of God: wherefore a shameful torment awaiteth them
  Not at all shall their wealth or their children avail them aught against God
 Companions shall they be of the fire: they shall abide therein for ever
  On the day when God shall raise them all, they will swear to Him as they now swear to you, deeming that it will avail them
  Are they not-yes they-the liars?  Satan hath gotten mastery over them, and made them forget the remembrance of God
 These are Satan's party
 What! shall not verily the party of Satan be for ever lost
  Verily, they who oppose God and His Apostle shall be among the most vile
 God hath written this decree: "I will surely prevail, and my Apostles also
" Truly God is Strong, Mighty
  Thou shalt not find that any of those who believe in God, and in the last day, love him who opposeth God and His Apostle, even though they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, or their nearest kin
 On the hearts of these hath God graven the Faith, and with His own Spirit hath He strengthened them; and He will bring them into gardens, beneath whose shades the rivers flow, to remain therein eternally
 God is well pleased in them, and they in Him
 These are God's party! Shall not, of a truth, a party of God be for ever blessed?   _______________________  1 Khaula, daughter of Thalaba, who had been divorced by the formula in verse 2, which was understood among the Arabs to imply perpetual separation

-THE PILGRIMAGE [CVII
]  MEDINA
1-78 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O MEN of Mecca, fear your Lord
 Verily, the earthquake of the last Hour will be a tremendous thing!  On the day when ye shall behold it, every suckling woman shall forsake her sucking babe; and every woman that hath a burden in her womb shall cast her burden; and thou shalt see men drunken, yet are they not drunken: but it is the mighty chastisement of God!  There is a man2 who, without knowledge, wrangleth about God, and followeth every rebellious Satan;  Concerning whom it is decreed, that he shall surely beguile and guide into the torment of the Flame, whoever shall take him for his Lord
  O men! if ye doubt as to the resurrection, yet, of a truth, have We created you of dust, then of the moist germs of life, then of clots of blood, then of pieces of flesh shapen and unshapen, that We might give you proofs of our power! And We cause one sex or the other, at our pleasure, to abide in the womb until the appointed time; then We bring you forth infants; then permit you to reach your age of strength; and one of you dieth, and another of you liveth on to an age so abject that all his former knowledge is clean forgotten!3 And thou hast seen the earth dried up and barren: but when We send down the rain upon it, it stirreth and swelleth, and groweth every kind of luxuriant herb
  This, for that God is the Truth, and that it is He who quickeneth the dead,- and that He hath power over everything:  And that "the Hour" will indeed come-there is no doubt of it-and that God will wake up to life those who are in the tombs
  A man there is who disputeth about God without knowledge or guidance or enlightening Book,  Turning aside in scorn to mislead others from the way of God! Disgrace shall be his in this world; and on the day of the resurrection, We will make him taste the torment of the burning:-  "This, for thy handywork of old! for God is not unjust to His servants
"  There are some who serve God in a single point
 If good come upon one of them, he resteth in it; but if trial come upon him, he turneth him round (to infidelity) with the loss both of this world and of the next! This same is the clear ruin!  He calleth upon that beside God which can neither hurt him nor profit him
 This same is the far-gone error!  He calleth on him who would sooner hurt than profit him
 Surely, bad the lord, and, surely, bad the vassal!  But God will bring in those who shall believe and do the things that are right, into gardens 'neath which the rivers flow: for God doth that which He pleaseth
  Let him who thinketh that God will not help His Apostle in this world and in the next, stretch a cord aloft as if to destroy himself; then let him cut it, and see whether his devices can bring that4 to nought at which he was angry!  Thus send we down the Koran with its clear signs (verses): and because God guideth whom He pleaseth
  As to those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabeites,5 and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who join other gods with God, of a truth, God shall decide between them on the day of resurrection: for God is witness of all things
  Seest thou not that all in the Heavens and all on the Earth adoreth God? the sun and the moon and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and many men? But of many is chastisement the due:  And whom God shall disgrace there shall be none to honour: God doth that which pleaseth Him
  These, the Faithful and the Infidels, are the two disputants who dispute concerning their Lord: but for those who have disbelieved, garments of fire shall be cut out; the boiling water shall be poured down upon their heads:  All that is in their bowels, and their skins, shall be dissolved: and there are maces of iron for them!  So oft as they, for very anguish, would fain come forth thence, back shall they be turned into it: and-"Taste ye the torment of the burning
"  But God will bring in those who shall have believed, and done the things that are right, into gardens 'neath which the rivers flow
 Adorned shall they be therein with golden bracelets and with pearls, and their raiment therein shall be of silk;  For they were guided to the best of words; guided to the glorious path!  But those who believe not, and seduce others from the way of God, and from the Holy Mosque which we have appointed to all men, alike for those who abide therein, and for the stranger;  And those who seek impiously to profane it, we will cause to taste a grievous punishment
  And call to mind when we assigned the site of the House6 to Abraham and said: "Unite not aught with Me in worship, and cleanse My House for those who go in procession round it, and who stand or bow in worship:"-  And proclaim to the peoples a PILGRIMAGE: Let them come to thee on foot and on every fleet7 camel, arriving by every deep defile:  That they may bear witness of its benefits to them, and may make mention of God's name on the appointed days,8 over the brute beasts with which He hath supplied them for sustenance: Therefore eat thereof yourselves, and feed the needy, the poor:  Then let them bring the neglect of their persons to a close,9 and let them pay their vows, and circuit the ancient House
  This do
 And he that respecteth the sacred ordinances of God, this will be best for him with his Lord
 The flesh of cattle is allowed you, save of those already specified to you
 Shun ye, therefore, the pollutions of idols; and shun ye the word of falsehood;  Sound in faith Godward, uniting no god with Him; for whoever uniteth gods with God, is like that which falleth from on high, and the birds snatch it away, or the wind wafteth it to a distant place
  This do
 And they who respect the rites of God, perform an action which proceedeth from piety of heart
  Ye may obtain advantages from the cattle up to the set time for slaying them: then, the place for sacrificing them is at the ancient House
  And to every people have we appointed rites, that they may commemorate the name of God over the brute beasts which He hath provided for them
 And your God is the one God
 To Him, therefore, surrender yourselves: and bear thou good tidings to those who humble them,-  Whose hearts, when mention is made of God, thrill with awe; and to those who remain steadfast under all that be-falleth them, and observe prayer, and give alms of that with which we have supplied them
  And the camels have we appointed you for the sacrifice to God: much good have ye in them
 Make mention, therefore, of the name of God over them when ye slay them, as they stand in a row; and when they are fallen over on their sides, eat of them, and feed him who is content and asketh not, and him who asketh
 Thus have We subjected them to you, to the intent ye should be thankful
10  By no means can their flesh reach unto God, neither their blood; but piety on your part reacheth Him
 Thus hath He subjected them to you, that ye might magnify God for His guidance: moreover, announce to those who do good deeds-  That God will ward off mischief from believers: for God loveth not the false, the Infidel
  A sanction is given to those who, because they have suffered outrages, have taken up arms; and verily, God is well able to succour them:  Those who have been driven forth from their homes wrongfully, only because they say "Our Lord is the God
" And if God had not repelled some men by others, cloisters, and churches, and oratories, and mosques, wherein the name of God is ever commemorated, would surely have been destroyed
 And him who helpeth God will God surely help:11 for God is right Strong, Mighty:-  Those who, if we establish them in this land, will observe prayer, and pay the alms of obligation, and enjoin what is right, and forbid what is evil
 And the final issue of all things is unto God
  Moreover, if they charge thee with imposture, then already, before them, the people of Noah, and Ad and Themoud, and the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot, and the dwellers in Madian, have charged their prophets with imposture! Moses, too, was charged with imposture! And I bore long with the unbelievers; then seize on them: and how great was the change I wrought!  And how many cities which had been ungodly, and whose roofs are now laid low in ruin, have We destroyed! And wells have been abandoned and lofty castles!  Have they not journeyed through the land? Have they not hearts to understand with, or ears to hear with? It is not that to these sights their eyes are blind, but the hearts in their breasts are blind!  And they will bid thee to hasten the chastisement
 But God cannot fail His threat
 And verily, a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years,12 as ye reckon them!  How many cities have I long borne with, wicked though they were, yet then laid hold on them to chastise them! Unto Me shall all return
  SAY: O men! I am only your open warner:  And they who believe and do the things that are right, shall have forgiveness and an honourable provision;  But those who strive to invalidate our signs shall be inmates of Hell
  We have not sent any apostle or prophet before thee, among whose desires Satan injected not some wrong desire, but God shall bring to nought that which Satan had suggested
 Thus shall God affirm His revelations13 for God is Knowing, Wise!  That He may make that which Satan hath injected, a trial to those in whose hearts is a disease, and whose hearts are hardened
-Verily, the wicked are in a far-gone severance from the truth!-  And that they to whom "the Knowledge" hath been given, may know that the Koran is the truth from thy Lord, and may believe in it, and their hearts may acquiesce in it: for God is surely the guider of those who believe, into the straight path
  But the Infidels will not cease to doubt concerning it, until "the Hour" come suddenly upon them, or until the chastisement of the day of desolation come upon them
  On that day the Kingdom shall be God's: He shall judge between them: and they who shall have believed and done the things that are right, shall be in gardens of delight:  But they who were Infidels and treated our signs as lies-these then-their's a shameful chastisement!  And as to those who fled their country for the cause of God, and were afterwards slain, or died, surely with goodly provision will God provide for them! for verily, God! He, surely, is the best of providers!  He will assuredly bring them in with an in-bringing that shall please them well: for verily, God is right Knowing, Gracious
  So shall it be
 And whoever in making exact reprisal for injury done him, shall again be wronged, God will assuredly aid him: for God is most Merciful, Gracious
  So shall it be; for that God causeth the night to enter in upon the day, and He causeth the day to enter in upon the night: and for that God Heareth, Seeth
  So shall it be, for that God is the truth; and because what they call on beside Him is vanity: and because God is the Lofty, the Mighty!  Seest thou not that God sendeth down water from Heaven, and that on the morrow the earth is clad with verdure? for God is benignant, cognisant of all
  His, all in the Heavens and all on Earth: and verily, God! He assuredly is the Rich, the Praiseworthy!  Seest thou not that God hath put under you whatever is in the earth; and the ships which traverse the sea at His bidding? And He holdeth back the heaven that it fall not on the earth, unless He permit it! for God is right Gracious to mankind, Merciful
  And He it is who hath given you life, then will cause you to die, then will give you life-of a truth man is all ungrateful
  To every people have we appointed observances which they observe
 Therefore, let them not dispute this matter with thee, but bid them to thy Lord, for thou art on the right way:  But if they debate with thee, then Say: God best knoweth what ye do!  God will judge between you on the day of resurrection, as to the matters wherein ye differ
  Knowest thou not that God knoweth whatever is in the Heaven and on the Earth? This truly is written in the Book: this truly is easy for God
  They worship beside God, that for which He hath sent down no warranty, and that of which they have no knowledge: but for those who commit this wrong, no helper!  And when our clear signs are rehearsed to them, thou mayst perceive disdain in the countenances of the Infidels
 Scarce can they refrain from rushing to attack those who rehearse our signs to them! SAY: Shall I tell you of worse than this? The fire which God hath threatened to those who believe not! Wretched the passage thither!  O men! a parable is set forth to you, wherefore hearken to it
 Verily, they on whom ye call beside God, cannot create a fly, though they assemble for it; and if the fly carry off aught from them, they cannot take it away from it! Weak the suppliant and the supplicated!  Unworthy the estimate they form of God!14 for God is right Powerful, Mighty!  God chooseth messengers from among the angels and from among men: verily, God Heareth, Seeth
  He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them; and unto God shall all things return
  Believers! bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your Lord, and work righteousness that you may fare well
  And do valiantly in the cause of God as it behoveth you to do for Him
 He hath elected you, and hath not laid on you any hardship in religion, the Faith of your father Abraham
 He hath named you the Muslims  Heretofore and in this Book, that the Apostles may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind
 Therefore observe prayer, and pay the legal impost, and cleave fast to God
 He is your liege Lord-a goodly Lord, and a goodly Helper!   _______________________  1 This Sura is generally said to have been revealed at Mecca,-but this is probably only the case with verses 1-24; 43-56; 60-65; 67-75

-THE VICTORY [CVIII

-29 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  Verily, We have won for thee an undoubted VICTORY1-  In token that God forgiveth thy earlier and later faults, and fulfilleth His goodness to thee, and guideth thee on the right way,  And that God succoureth thee with a mighty succour
  He it is who sendeth down a spirit of secure repose into the hearts of the faithful that they might add faith to their faith; (for God's are the armies of the Heavens and of the Earth: and God is Knowing, Wise:)  And that He may bring the believing men and the believing women into gardens 'neath whose trees the rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever, and that He may cancel their evil deeds: for this is the great bliss with God:  And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the men and women who join other gods with God, and think evil thoughts of Him
 Theirs shall be a round of evil; and God is angry with them and curseth them, and hath prepared Hell for them: and, an evil journey thither!  The armies of the Heavens and of the Earth are God's, and God is Mighty, Wise!  Verily, we have sent thee to be a witness and a herald of good (an announcer), and a warner,  That ye may believe on God and on His Apostle; and may assist Him, and honour Him, and praise him, morning and evening
  In truth, they who plighted fealty to thee, really plighted that fealty to God: the hand of God was over their hands! Whoever, therefore, shall break his oath shall only break it to his own hurt; but whoever shall be true to his engagement with God, He will give him a great reward
  The Arabs who took not the field with you,2 will say to thee,3 "We were engaged with our property and our families; therefore ask thou pardon for us
" They speak with their tongues what is not in their hearts
 SAY: And who can have any power over God in your behalf, whether he will you some loss, or whether he will you an advantage? Yes, God is acquainted with your doings
  But ye thought that the Apostle and the faithful could never more come back to their families; and your hearts were pleased at this; and ye thought an evil thought of this expedition, and ye became an undone people:  For, whoso believeth not in God, and His Apostle
 
 
 
  Verily, we have got ready the flame for the Infidels!  And God's is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth: Whom He will He forgiveth, and whom He will He punisheth: and God is Gracious, Merciful!  They who took not the field with you will say, when ye go forth to the spoil to take it, "Let us follow you
" Fain would they change the word of God
4 SAY: Ye shall by no means follow us: thus hath God said already
 They will say, "Nay, ye are jealous of us
" Nay! they are men of little understanding
  SAY to those Arabs of the desert, who took not the field, ye shall be called forth against a people of mighty valour
 Ye shall do battle with them, or they shall profess Islam
 If ye obey, a goodly recompense will God give you; but if ye turn back, as ye turned back aforetime, He will chastise you with a sore chastisement
  It shall be no crime on the part of the blind, the lame, or the sick, if they go not to the fight
 But whoso shall obey God and His Apostle, he shall bring him into the gardens 'neath which the rivers flow: but whoso shall turn back, He will punish him with a sore punishment
  Well pleased now hath God been with the believers when they plighted fealty to thee under the tree;5 and He knew what was in their hearts: therefore did He send down upon them a spirit of secure repose, and rewarded them with a speedy victory,  And with the rich booty which they took: for God is Mighty, Wise!  God promised you the taking of a rich booty6 and sped it to you; and He withheld men's hands from you, for a sign to the faithful, and that He might guide you along the right way:-  And other booty, over which ye have not yet had power: but now hath God compassed them for you; for God is over all things Potent
  If the Infidels shall fight against you, they shall assuredly turn their backs; then, neither protector nor helper shall they find!  Such is God's method carried into effect of old; no change canst thou find in God's mode of dealing
  And He it was who held their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca,7 after that He had given you the victory over them: for God saw what ye did
  These are they who believed not, and kept you away from the sacred Mosque, as well as the offering which was prevented from reaching the place of sacrifice
 And had it not been that ye would have trodden down believers, both men and women, whom ye knew not, so that a crime might have lighted on you without your knowledge on their account, and that God would bring whom He will within His mercy, this would have been otherwise ordered
 Had they been apart,8 we had surely punished such of them as believed not, with a sore punishment
  When the unbelievers had fostered rage in their hearts-the rage of ignorance (of heathens)-God sent down His peace on His Apostle and on the faithful, and stablished in them the word of piety, for they were most worthy and deserving of it: and God knoweth all things
  Now hath God in truth made good to His Apostle the dream9 in which he said, "Ye shall surely enter the sacred Mosque, if God will, in full security, having your heads shaved and your hair cut: ye shall not fear; for He knoweth what ye know not; and He hath ordained you, beside this, a speedy victory
"  It is He who hath sent His Apostle with "the Guidance," and the religion of truth, that He may exalt it above every religion
 And enough for thee is this testimony on the part of God
  Muhammad is the Apostle of God; and his comrades are vehement against the infidels, but full of tenderness among themselves
 Thou mayst see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, imploring favours from God, and His acceptance
 Their tokens10 are on their faces, the marks of their prostrations
 This is their picture in the Law, and their picture in the Evangel:11 they are as the seed which putteth forth its stalk; then strengtheneth it, and it groweth stout, and riseth upon its stem,12 rejoicing the husbandman-that the infidels may be wrathful at them
 To such of them as believe and do the things that are right, hath God promised forgiveness and a noble recompense

-THE FORBIDDING [CIX

-12 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  WHY,1 O Prophet! dost thou hold that to be FORBIDDEN which God hath made lawful to thee, from a desire to please thy wives, since God is Lenient, Merciful?  God hath allowed you release from your oaths; and God is your master: and He is the Knowing, Wise
  When the prophet told a recent occurrence as a secret to one of his wives, and when she divulged it and God informed him of this, he acquainted her with part and withheld part
2 And when he had told her of it, she said, "Who told thee this?" He said, "The Knowing, the Sage hath told it me
  "If ye both be turned to God in penitence, for now have your hearts gone astray 
 
 
 
3 but if ye conspire against the Prophet, then know that God is his Protector, and Gabriel, and every just man among the faithful; and the angels are his helpers besides
  "Haply if he put you both away, his Lord will give him in exchange other wives better than you, Muslims, believers, devout, penitent, obedient, observant of fasting, both known of men and virgins
"  O Believers! save yourselves and your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and mighty: they disobey not God in what He hath commanded them, but execute His behests
  O ye Infidels! make no excuses for yourselves this day; ye shall surely be recompensed according to your works
  O Believers! turn to God with the turning of true penitence; haply your Lord will cancel your evil deeds, and will bring you into the gardens 'neath which the rivers flow, on the day when God will not shame the Prophet, nor those who have shared his faith: their light shall run before them, and on their right hands! they shall say, "Lord perfect our light, and pardon us: for thou hast power over all things
"  O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them
 Hell shall be their abode! and wretched the passage to it!  God setteth forth as an example to unbelievers the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot; they were under two of our righteous servants, both of whom they deceived: but their husbands availed them nought against God: and it shall be said "Enter ye into the fire with those who enter
"  God also holdeth forth to those who believe the example of the wife of Pharaoh,4 when she said, "Lord, build me an house with thee in Paradise, and deliver me from Pharaoh and his doings; and deliver me from the wicked:"  And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who kept her maidenhood, and into whose womb5 we breathed of our spirit, and who believed in the words of her Lord and His Scriptures, and was one of the devout

 Hafsa, who had been greatly incensed at their amour, of which Muhammad had himself informed her, communicated the matter in confidence to Ayesha, from whose altered manner, probably, the prophet found that his secret had been betrayed
 To free Muhammad from his obligation to Hafsa was the object of this chapter

-SHE WHO IS TRIED [CX
]  MEDINA
-13 Versus  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O YE who believe! take not my foe2 and your foe for friends, shewing them kindness, although they believe not that truth which hath come to you: they drive forth the Apostles and yourselves because ye believe in God your Lord! If ye go forth to fight on my way, and from a desire to please me, and shew them kindness in private, I well know what ye conceal, and what ye discover! Whoso doth this hath already gone astray from the even way
  If they meet with you they will prove your foes: hand and tongue will they put forth for your hurt, and will desire that you become infidels again
  Neither your kindred nor your children shall at all avail you on the day of the resurrection
 A severance between you will it make! and your actions doth God behold
  A good example had ye in Abraham,3 and in those who followed him, when they said to their people, "Verily, we are clear of you, and of what ye worship beside God: we renounce you: and between us and hath hatred and enmity sprung up for ever, until ye believe in God alone
" Yet imitate not the language of Abraham to his Father, "I will pray for thy forgiveness, but not aught shall I obtain for thee from God
"4 O our Lord! in thee do we trust! to thee do we turn! to thee we shall come back at the last
  O our Lord! expose us not for trial to the unbelievers, and forgive us: for thou art the Mighty, the Wise!  A good example had ye in them, for all who hope in God and in the last day
 But let who will turn back, God truly is the Rich, the Praiseworthy!  God will, perhaps, establish good will between yourselves and those of them whom ye take to be your enemies:5 God is Powerful: and God is Gracious, Merciful
  God doth not forbid you to deal with kindness and fairness toward those who have not made war upon you on account of your religion, or driven you forth from your homes: for God loveth those who act with fairness
>Only doth God forbid you to make friends of those who, on account of your religion, have warred against you, and have driven you forth from your homes, and have aided those who drove you forth: and whoever maketh friends of them are wrong- doers
  O Believers!6 when believing women come over to you as refugees (Mohadjers), then make TRIAL of them
 God best knoweth their faith; but if ye have also ascertained their faith, let them not go back to the infidels; they are not lawful for them, nor are the unbelievers lawful for these women
 But give them back what they have spent for their dowers
 No crime shall it be in you to marry them, provided ye give them their dowers
 Do not retain any right in the infidel women, but demand back what you have spent for their dowers, and let the unbelievers demand back what they have spent for their wives
7 This is the ordinance of God which He ordaineth among you: and God is Knowing, Wise
  And if any of your wives escape from you to the Infidels from whom ye afterwards take any spoil, then give to those whose wives shall have fled away, the like of what they shall have spent for their dowers; and fear God in whom ye believe
  O Prophet! when believing women come to thee, and pledge themselves that they will not associate aught with God, and that they will not steal or commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring scandalous charges,8 nor disobey thee in what is right, then plight thou thy faith to them, and ask pardon for them of God: for God is Indulgent, Merciful!  O Believers! enter not into amity with those against whom God is angered; they despair of the life to come, even as the Infidels despair of the inmates of the tombs

2  O Believers! raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, neither speak loud to him as ye speak loud one to another, lest your works come to nought, and ye unaware of it
  They who lower their voices in the presence of the Apostle of God, are the persons whose hearts God hath inclined to piety
 Forgiveness shall be theirs and a rich reward
  They who call out to thee while thou art within3 thine APARTMENTS, have most of them no right perception of what is due to thee
  But if they wait patiently till thou come forth to them, it were far better for them
 But God is Indulgent, Merciful
  O Believers! if any bad man4 come to you with news, clear it up at once, lest through ignorance ye harm others, and speedily have to repent of what ye have done
  And know that an Apostle of God is among you! should he give way to you in many matters ye would certainly become guilty of a crime
 But God hath endeared the faith to you, and hath given it favour in your hearts, and hath made unbelief, and wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you
 Such are they who pursue a right course
  Through the bounty and grace which is from God: and God is Knowing, Wise
  If two bodies of the faithful are at war, then make ye peace between them:5 and if the one of them wrong the other, fight against that party which doth the wrong, until they come back to the precepts of God: if they come back, make peace between them with fairness, and act impartially; God loveth those who act with impartiality
  Only the faithful are brethren; wherefore make peace between your brethren; and fear God, that ye may obtain mercy
  O Believers! let not men laugh men to scorn who haply may be better than themselves; neither let women laugh women to scorn who may haply be better than themselves!6 Neither defame one another, nor call one another by nicknames
 Bad is it to be called wicked after having professed the faith:7 and whoso repent not of this are doers of wrong
  O Believers! avoid frequent suspicions, for some suspicions are a crime; and pry not: neither let the one of you traduce another in his absence
 Would any one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely ye would loathe it
 And fear ye God: for God is Ready to turn, Merciful
  O men! verily, we have created you of a male and a female; and we have divided you into peoples and tribes that ye might have knowledge one of another
 Truly, the most worthy of honour in the sight of God is he who feareth Him most

  The Arabs of the desert9 say, "We believe

1-IMMUNITY [CXIII
]  MEDINA
-130 Verses  An IMMUNITY from God and His Apostle to those with whom ye are in league, among the Polytheist Arabs! (those who join gods with God)
  Go ye, therefore, at large in the land four months: but know that God ye shall not weaken;2 and that those who believe not, God will put to shame-  And a proclamation on the part of God and His Apostle to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage, that God is free from any engagement with the votaries of other gods with God as is His Apostle! If, therefore, ye turn to God it will be better for you; but if ye turn back, then know that ye shall not weaken God: and to those who believe not, announce thou a grievous punishment
  But this concerneth not those Polytheists with whom ye are in league, and who shall have afterwards in no way failed you, nor aided anyone against you
 Observe, therefore, engagement with them through the whole time of their treaty: for God loveth those who fear Him
  And when the sacred months3 are passed, kill those who join other gods with God wherever ye shall find them; and seize them, besiege them, and lay wait for them with every kind of ambush: but if they shall convert, and observe prayer, and pay the obligatory alms, then let them go their way, for God is Gracious, Merciful
  If any one of those who join gods with God ask an asylum of thee, grant him an asylum, that he may hear the Word of God, and then let him reach his place of safety
 This, for that they are people devoid of knowledge
  How shall they who add gods to God be in league with God and with His Apostle, save those with whom ye made a league at the sacred temple? So long as they are true to you, be ye true to them; for God loveth those who fear Him
  How can they? since if they prevail against you, they will not regard in you either ties of blood or faith
 With their mouths will they content you, but their hearts will be averse
 The greater part of them are perverse doers
  They sell the signs of God for a mean price, and turn others aside from his way: evil is it that they do!  They regard not in a believer either ties of blood or faith; these are the transgressors!  Yet if they turn to God and observe prayer, and pay the impost, then are they your brethren in religion
 We make clear our signs to those who understand
  But if, after alliance made, they break their oaths and revile your religion, then do battle with the ring-leaders of infidelity-for no oaths are binding with them that they may desist
  What! will ye not fight against those Meccans who have broken their oaths and aimed to expel your Apostle, and attacked you first? Will ye dread them? God is more worthy of your fear, if ye are believers!  So make war on them: By your hands will God chastise them, and will put them to shame, and will give you victory over them, and will heal the bosoms of a people who believe;  And will take away the wrath of their hearts
 God will be turned unto whom He will: and God is Knowing, Wise
  Think ye that ye shall be forsaken as if God did not yet know those among you who do valiantly, and take none for their friends beside God, and His Apostle, and the faithful? God is well apprised of your doings
  It is not for the votaries of other gods with God, witnesses against themselves of infidelity, to visit the temples of God
 These! vain their works: and in the fire shall they abide for ever!  He only should visit the temples of God who believeth in God and the last day, and observeth prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and dreadeth none but God
 These haply will be among the rightly guided
  Do ye place the giving drink to the pilgrims, and the visitation of the sacred temple,4 on the same level with him who believeth in God and the last day, and fighteth on the way of God? They shall not be held equal by God: and God guideth not the unrighteous
  They who have believed, and fled their homes, and striven with their substance and with their persons on the path of God, shall be of highest grade with God: and these are they who shall be happy!  Tidings of mercy from Himself, and of His good pleasure, doth their Lord send them, and of gardens in which lasting pleasure shall be theirs;  Therein shall they abide for ever; for God! with Him is a great reward
  O Believers! make not friends of your fathers or your brethren if they love unbelief above faith: and whoso of you shall make them his friends, will be wrong doers
  SAY: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your kindred, and the wealth which ye have gained, and merchandise which ye fear may be unsold, and dwellings wherein ye delight, be dearer to you than God and His Apostle and efforts on his Path, then wait until God shall Himself enter on His work:5 and God guideth not the impious
  Now hath God helped you in many battlefields, and, on the day of Honein,6 when ye prided yourselves on your numbers; but it availed you nothing; and the earth, with all its breadth, became too straight for you:7 then turned ye your backs in flight:  Then did God send down His spirit of repose8 upon His Apostle, and upon the faithful, and He sent down the hosts which ye saw not, and He punished the Infidels: This, the Infidels' reward!  Yet, after this, will God be turned to whom He pleaseth; for God is Gracious, Merciful!  O Believers! only they who join gods with God are unclean! Let them not, therefore, after this their year, come near the sacred Temple
 And if ye fear want,9 God, if He please, will enrich you of His abundance: for God is Knowing, Wise
  Make war upon such of those to whom the Scriptures have been given as believe not in God, or in the last day, and who forbid not that which God and His Apostle have forbidden, and who profess not the profession of the truth, until they pay tribute out of hand,10 and they be humbled
11  The Jews say, "Ezra (Ozair) is a son of God";12 and the Christians say, "The Messiah is a son of God
" Such the sayings in their mouths! They resemble the saying of the Infidels of old! God do battle with them! How are they misguided!  They take their teachers, and their monks, and the Messiah, son of Mary, for Lords13 beside God, though bidden to worship one God only
 There is no God but He! Far from His glory be what they associate with Him!  Fain would they put out God's light with their mouths: but God only desireth to perfect His light, albeit the Infidels abhor it
  He it is who hath sent His Apostle with the Guidance and a religion of the truth, that He may make it victorious14 over every other religion, albeit they who assign partners to God be averse from it
  O Believers! of a truth, many of the teachers and monks do devour man's substance in vanity, and turn them from the Way of God
 But to those who treasure up gold and silver and expend it not in the Way of God, announce tidings of a grievous torment
  On that day their treasures shall be heated in hell fire, and their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs, shall be branded with them
 
 
 
 "This is what ye have treasured up for yourselves: taste, therefore, your treasures!"  Twelve months is the number of months with God,15 according to God's book, since the day when He created the Heavens and the Earth: of these four are sacred: this is the right usage: But wrong not yourselves therein; attack those who join gods with God in all, as they attack you in all: and know that God is with those who fear Him
  To carry over a sacred month to another, is only a growth of infidelity
 The Infidels are led into error by it
 They allow it one year, and forbid it another, that they may make good the number of months which God hath hallowed, and they allow that which God hath prohibited
 The evil of their deeds hath been prepared for them by Satan: for God guideth not the people who do not believe
  O Believers! what possessed you, that when it was said to you, "March forth on the Way of God," ye sank heavily earthwards? What! prefer ye the life of this world to the next? But the fruition of this mundane life, in respect of that which is to come, is but little
16  Unless ye march forth, with a grievous chastisement will He chastise you; and He will place another people in your stead, and ye shall in no way harm Him: for over everything is God potent
  If ye assist not your Prophet 
 
 
 God assisted him formerly, when the unbelievers drove him forth, in company with a second only!17 when they two were in the cave; when the Prophet said to his companion, "Be not distressed; verily, God is with us
" And God sent down His tranquillity upon him, and strengthened him with hosts ye saw not, and made the word of those who believed not the abased, and the word of God was the exalted: for God is Mighty, Wise
  March ye forth the light and heavy armed,18 and contend with your substance and your persons on the Way of God
 This, if ye know it, will be better for you
  Had there been a near advantage and a short journey, they would certainly have followed thee; but the way seemed long to them
19 Yet will they swear by God, "Had we been able, we had surely gone forth with you:" they are self- destroyers! And God knoweth that they are surely liars!  God forgive thee! Why didst thou give them leave to stay behind, ere they who make true excuses had become known to thee, and thou hadst known the liars?  They who believe in God and in the last day will not ask leave of thee to be exempt from contending with their substance and their persons
 But God knoweth those who fear Him!  They only will ask thy leave who believe not in God and the last day, and whose hearts are full of doubts, and who are tossed up and down in their doubtings
  Moreover, had they been desirous to take the field, they would have got ready for that purpose the munitions of war
20  But God was averse to their marching forth, and made them laggards; and it was said, "Sit ye at home with those who sit
"  Had they taken the field with you, they would only have added a burden to you, and have hurried about among you, stirring you up to sedition; and some there are among you who would have listened to them: and God knoweth the evil doers
  Of old aimed they at sedition, and deranged thy affairs, until the truth arrived, and the behest of God became apparent, averse from it though they were
  Some of them say to thee, "Allow me to remain at home, and expose me not to the trial
" Have they not fallen into a trial already? But verily, Hell shall environ the Infidels!  If a success betide thee, it annoyeth them: but if a reverse betide thee, they say, "We took our own measures before:" and they turn their backs and are glad
  SAY: Nothing can befall us but what God hath destined21 for us
 Our liege- lord is He; and on God let the faithful trust!  SAY: Await ye for us, other than one of the two best things?22 But we await for you the infliction of a chastisement by God, from himself, or at our hands
 Wait ye then; we verily will wait with you
  SAY: Make ye your offerings willingly or by constraint; it cannot be accepted from you, because ye are a wicked people:  And nothing hindreth the acceptance of their offerings, but that they believe not in God and His Apostle, and discharge not the duty of prayer but with sluggishness, and make not offerings but with reluctance
  Let not, therefore, their riches or their children amaze thee
 God is only minded to punish them by means of these, in this life present, and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers
23  And they swear by God that they are indeed of you, yet they are not of you, but they are people who are afraid of you:  If they find a place of refuge, or caves, or a hiding place, they assuredly turn towards it and haste thereto
  Some of them also defame thee in regard to the alms; yet if a part be given them, they are content, but if no part be given them, behold, they are angry!  Would that they were satisfied with that which God and His Apostle had given them, and would say "God sufficeth us! God will vouchsafe unto us of His favour, and so will His Apostle: verily unto God do we make our suit!"  But alms are only to be given to the poor and the needy,24 and those who collect them, and to those25 whose hearts are won to Islam, and for ransoms, and for debtors, and for the cause of God, and the wayfarer
 This is an ordinance from God: and God is Knowing, Wise
  There are some of them who injure26 the Prophet and say, "He is all ear
" Say: An ear of good to you! He believeth in God, and believeth the believers: and is a mercy to such of you as believe:  But they who injure the Apostle of God, shall suffer a dolorous chastisement
  They swear to you by God to please you; but worthier is God, and His Apostle, that they should please Him, if they are believers
  Know they not, that for him who opposeth God and His Apostle, is surely the fire of Hell, in which he shall remain for ever? This is the great ignominy!  The hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down concerning them, to tell them plainly what is in their hearts
  SAY: Scoff ye; but God will bring to light that which ye are afraid of
  And if thou question them, they will surely say, "We were only discoursing and jesting
" SAY: What! do ye scoff at God, and His signs, and His Apostle?  Make no excuse: from faith ye have passed to infidelity! If we forgive some of you, we will punish others: for that they have been evil doers
  Hypocritical men and women imitate one another
27 They enjoin what is evil, and forbid what is just, and shut up their hands
28 They have forgotten God, and He hath forgotten them
 Verily, the hypocrites are the perverse doers
  God promiseth the hypocritical men and women, and the unbelievers, the fire of Hell-therein shall they abide-this their sufficing portion! And God hath cursed them, and a lasting torment shall be theirs
  Ye act like those who flourished before you
 Mightier were they than you in prowess, and more abundant in wealth and children, and they enjoyed their portion: so ye also enjoy your portion, as they who were before you enjoyed theirs; and ye hold discourses like their discourses
 These! vain their works both for this world and for that which is to come! These! they are the lost ones
  Hath not the history reached them of those who were before them?-of the people of Noah,29 and of Ad, and of Themoud, and of the people of Abraham, and of the inhabitants of Madian, and of the overthrown cities? Their apostles came to them with clear proofs of their mission: God would not deal wrongly by them, but they dealt wrongly by themselves
  The faithful of both sexes are mutual friends: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil; they observe prayer, and pay the legal impost, and they obey God and His Apostle
 On these will God have mercy: verily, God is Mighty, Wise
  To the faithful, both men and women, God promiseth gardens 'neath which the rivers flow, in which they shall abide, and goodly mansions in the gardens of Eden
 But best of all will be God's good pleasure in them
 This will be the great bliss
  O Prophet! contend against the infidels and the hypocrites, and be rigorous with them: Hell shall be their dwelling place! Wretched the journey thither!  They swear by God that they said no such thing: yet spake they the word of infidelity, and from Muslims became unbelievers! They planned what they could not effect;30 and only disapproved of it because God and His Apostle had enriched them by His bounty! If they repent it will be better for them; but if they fall back into their sin, with a grievous chastisement will God chastise them in this world and the next, and on earth they shall have neither friend nor protector!  Some there are of them who made this agreement with God-"If truly He give us of His bounties, we will surely give alms and surely be of the righteous
"  Yet when he had vouchsafed them of His bounty, they became covetous thereof, and turned their backs, and withdrew afar off:  So He caused hypocrisy to take its turn in their hearts, until the day on which they shall meet Him-for that they failed their promise to God, and that they were liars!  Know they not that God knoweth their secrets and their private talk, and that God knoweth the secret things?  They who traduce such of the faithful as give their alms freely, and those who find nothing to give but their earnings, and scoff at them, God shall scoff at them; and there is a grievous torment in store for them
  Ask thou forgiveness for them, or ask it not, it will be the same
 If thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will by no means forgive them
 This, for that they believe not in God and His Apostle! And God guideth not the ungodly people
  They who were left at home were delighted to stay behind God's Apostle, and were averse from contending with their riches and their persons for the cause of God, and said, "March not out in the heat
" SAY: A fiercer heat will be the fire of Hell
" Would that they understood this
  Little, therefore, let them laugh, and much let them weep, as the meed of their doings!  If God bring thee back from the fight to some of them, and they ask thy leave to take the field, SAY: By no means shall ye ever take the field with me, and by no means shall ye fight an enemy with me: ye were well pleased to sit at home at the first crisis: sit ye at home, then, with those who lag behind
  Never pray thou over anyone of them who dieth, or stand at his grave31- because they believed not in God and His Apostle, and died in their wickedness
  Let not their riches or their children astonish thee: through these God is fain only to punish them in this world, and that their souls should depart while they are still infidels
  When a Sura was sent down with "Believe in God and go forth to war with His Apostle," those of them who are possessed of riches demanded exemption, and said, "Allow us to be with those who sit at home
  Well content were they to be with those who stay behind: for a seal hath been set on their hearts so that they understand not:-  But the Apostle and those who share his faith, contend for the faith with purse and person; and these! all good things await them: and these are they who shall be happy
  God hath made ready for them gardens 'neath which the rivers flow, wherein they shall remain for ever: this will be the great bliss
  Some Arabs of the desert came with excuses, praying exemption; and they who had gainsaid God and His Apostle sat at home: a grievous punishment shall light on such of them as believe not
  It shall be no crime in the weak, and in the sick, and in those who find not the means of contributing, to stay at home, provided they are sincere with God and His Apostle
 Against those who act virtuously, there is no cause of blame: and God is Gracious, Merciful:-  Nor against those, to whom when they came to thee that thou shouldst mount them, thou didst say "I find not wherewith to mount you," and they turned away their eyes shedding floods of tears for grief, because they found no means to contribute
  Only is there cause of blame against those who, though they are rich, ask thee for exemption
 They are pleased to be with those who stay behind; and God hath set a seal upon their hearts: they have no knowledge
  They will excuse themselves to you when ye come back to them
 SAY: Excuse yourselves not; we cannot believe you: now hath God informed us about you: God will behold your doings, and so will His Apostle: to Him who knoweth alike things hidden and things manifest shall ye hereafter be brought back: and He will tell you what ye have done
  They will adjure you by God when ye are come back to them, to withdraw from them: Withdraw from them, then, for they are unclean: their dwelling shall be Hell, in recompense for their deserts
  They will adjure you to take pleasure in them; but if ye take pleasure in them, God truly will take no pleasure in those who act corruptly
  The Arabs of the desert are most stout in unbelief and dissimulation; and likelier it is that they should be unaware of the laws which God hath sent down to His Apostle: and God is Knowing, Wise
  Of the Arabs of the desert there are some who reckon what they expend in the cause of God as tribute, and wait for some change of fortune to befall you: a change for evil shall befall them! God is the Hearer, the Knower
  And of the Arabs of the desert, some believe in God and in the last day, and deem those alms an approach to God and to the Apostle's prayers
 Are they not their approach? Into His mercy shall God lead them: yes, God is Indulgent, Merciful
  As for those who led the way, the first of the Mohadjers,32 and the Ansars, and those who have followed their noble conduct, God is well pleased with them, and they with Him: He hath made ready for them gardens under whose trees the rivers flow: to abide therein for aye: this shall be the great bliss:  And of the Arabs of the desert round about you, some are hypocrites: and of the people of Medina, some are stubborn in hypocrisy
 Thou knowest them not, Muhammad: we know them: twice33 will we chastise them: then shall they be given over to a great chastisement
  Others have owned their faults, and with an action that is right they have mixed another that is wrong
 God will haply be turned to them: for God is Forgiving, Merciful
  Take alms of their substance,34 that thou mayst cleanse and purify them thereby, and pray for them; for thy prayers shall assure their minds: and God Heareth, Knoweth
  Know they not that when his servants turn to Him with repentance, God accepteth it, and that He accepteth alms, and that God is He who turneth, the Merciful?  SAY: Work ye: but God will behold your work, and so will His Apostle, and the faithful: and ye shall be brought before Him who knoweth alike the Hidden and the Manifest, and He will tell you of all your works
  And others await the decision of God; whether He will punish them, or whether He will be turned unto them: but God is Knowing, Wise
  There are some35 who have built a Mosque for mischief36 and for infidelity, and to disunite the faithful, and in expectation of him37 who, in time past, warred against God and His Apostle
 They will surely swear, "Our aim was only good:" but God is witness that they are liars
  Never set thou foot in it
38 There is a Mosque39 founded from its first day in piety
 More worthy is it that thou enter therein: therein are men who aspire to purity, and God loveth the purified
  Which of the two is best? He who hath founded his building on the fear of God and the desire to please Him, or he who hath founded his building on the brink of an undermined bank washed away by torrents, so that it rusheth with him into the fire of Hell? But God guideth not the doers of wrong
  Their building which they40 have built will not cease to cause uneasiness in their hearts, until their hearts are cut in pieces
41 God is Knowing, Wise
  Verily, of the faithful hath God bought their persons and their substance, on condition of Paradise for them in return: on the path of God shall they fight, and slay, and be slain: a Promise for this is pledged in the Law, and in the Evangel, and in the Koran-and who more faithful, in to his engagement than God? Rejoice, therefore, in the contract that ye have contracted: for this shall be the great bliss
  Those who turn to God, and those who serve, who praise, who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, who enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil, and keep to the bounds42 of God 
 
 
43 Wherefore bear these good tidings to the faithful
  It is not for the prophet or the faithful to pray for the forgiveness of those, even though they be of kin, who associate other beings with God, after it hath been made clear to them that they are to be the inmates of Hell
  For neither did Abraham ask forgiveness for his father, but in pursuance of a promise which he had promised to him: but when it was shewn him that he was an enemy to God, he declared himself clear of him
 Yet Abraham was pitiful, kind
  Nor is it for God to lead a people into error, after he hath guided them aright, until that which they ought to dread hath been clearly shewn them
 Verily, God knoweth all things
  God! His the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! He maketh alive and killeth! Ye have no patron or helper save God
  Now hath God turned Him unto the Prophet and unto the refugees (Mohadjers), and unto the helpers (Ansars)44, who followed him in the hour of distress, after that the hearts of a part of them had well nigh failed them45
 Then turned He unto them, for He was Kind to them, Merciful
  He hath also turned Him unto the three46 who were left behind, so that the earth, spacious as it is, became too strait for them; and their souls became so straitened within them, that they bethought them that there was no refuge from God but unto Himself
 Then was He turned to them, that they might be turned to Him, for God is He that turneth, the Merciful
  Believers!47 fear God, and be with the sincere
  No cause had the people of Medina and the Arabs of the desert around them, to abandon God's Apostle, or to prefer their own lives to his; because neither thirst, nor the labour nor hunger, could come upon them when on path of God;48 neither do they step a step which may anger the unbelievers, neither do they receive from the enemy any damage, but it is written down to them as a good work
 Verily, God suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish
  Nor give they alms either small or great, nor traverse they a torrent, but it is thus reckoned to them; that God may reward them with better than they have wrought
  The faithful must not march forth all together to the wars: and if a party of every band of them march not out, it is that they may instruct themselves in their religion, and may warn their people when they come back to them, that they take heed to themselves
  Believers! wage war against such of the infidels as are your neighbours, and let them find you rigorous: and know that God is with those who fear him
  Whenever a Sura is sent down, there are some of them who say, "Whose faith hath it increased?" It will increase the faith of those who believe, and they shall rejoice
  But as to those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add doubt to their doubt, and they shall die infidels
  Do they not see that they are proved every year once or twice? Yet they turn not, neither are they warned
  And whenever a Sura is sent down, they look at one another
 
 
 
  "Doth any one see you?" then turn they aside
 God shall turn their hearts aside, because they are a people devoid of understanding
  Now hath an Apostle come unto you from among yourselves: your iniquities press heavily upon him
 He is careful over you, and towards the faithful, compassionate, merciful
  If they turn away, SAY: God sufficeth me: there is no God but He
 In Him put I my trust
 He is the possessor of the Glorious Throne!   _______________________  1 The "Immunity" is said by some commentators to have formed originally one Sura with the eighth, p
375, and that on this account the usual formula of invocation is not prefixed

-THE TABLE [CXIV
]  MEDINA
-120 Verses  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  O BELIEVERS! be faithful to your engagements
 You are allowed the flesh of cattle other than what is hereinafter recited, except game, which is not allowed you while ye are on pilgrimage
 Verily, God ordaineth what he pleaseth
  O Believers! violate neither the rites of God, nor the sacred month Muharram, nor the offering, nor its ornaments1, nor those who press on to the sacred house seeking favour from their Lord and his good pleasure in them
  But when all is over2, then take to the chase: and let not ill will at those3 who would have kept you from the sacred mosque lead you to transgress4, but rather be helpful to one another according to goodness and piety, but be not helpful for evil and malice: and fear ye God
 Verily, God is severe in punishing!  That which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and all that hath been sacrificed under the invocation of any other name than that of God, and the strangled, and the killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by goring5, and that which hath been eaten by beasts of prey, unless ye make it clean by giving the death-stroke yourselves, and that which hath been sacrificed on the blocks of stone6, is forbidden you: and to make division of the slain by consulting the arrows,7 is impiety in you
 Woe this day on those who forsake your religion! And fear them not, but fear Me
  This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have filled up the measure of my favours upon you: and it is my pleasure that Islam be your religion; but whoso without wilful leanings to wrong shall be forced by hunger to transgress, to him,verily, will God be Indulgent, Merciful
  They will ask thee what is made lawful for them
 Say: Those things which are good8 are legalised to you, and the prey of beasts of chase which ye have trained like dogs, teaching them as God hath taught you
 Eat, therefore, of what they shall catch for you, and make mention of the name of God over it, and fear God: Verily, Swift is God to reckon:  This day, things healthful are legalised to you, and the meats of those who have received the Scriptures are allowed to you, as your meats are to them
 And you are permitted to marry virtuous women who are believers, and virtuous women of those who have received the Scriptures before you, when you shall have provided them their portions, living chastely with them without fornication, and without taking concubines
 Vain the works of him who shall renounce the faith! and in the next world he shall be of the lost
  O Believers! when ye address yourselves to prayer, wash your faces, and your hands up to the elbow, and wipe your heads, and your feet to the ankles
  And if ye have become unclean, then purify yourselves
 But if ye are sick, or on a journey, or if one of you come from the place of retirement, or if ye have touched women, and ye find no water, then take clean sand and rub your faces and your hands with it
9 God desireth not to lay a burden upon you, but he desireth to purify you, and He would fill up the measure of His favour upon you, that ye may be grateful
  And remember the favour of God upon you, and His covenant which He hath covenanted with you, when ye said, "We have heard and will obey;"10 and fear God; verily, God knoweth the very secrets of the breast
  O Believers! stand up as witnesses for God by righteousness: and let not ill- will at any, induce you not to act uprightly
 Act uprightly
 Next will this be to the fear of God
 And fear ye God: verily, God is apprised of what ye do
  God hath promised to those who believe, and do the things that are right, that for them is pardon and a great reward
  But they who are Infidels and treat our signs as lies-these shall be mated with Hell fire
  O Believers! recollect God's favour upon you, when11 certain folk were minded to stretch forth their hands against you, but He kept their hands from you
 Fear God then: and on God let the faithful trust
  Of old did God accept the covenant of the children of Israel,12 and out of them we raised up twelve leaders, and God said, "Verily, I will be with you
 If ye observe prayer and pay the obligatory alms, and believe in my Apostles and help them, and lend God a liberal loan, I will surely put away from you your evil deeds, and I will bring you into gardens 'neath which the rivers flow! But whoso of you after this believeth not, hath gone astray from the even path
"  But for their breaking their covenant we have cursed them, and have hardened their hearts
 They shift the words of Scripture from their places, and have forgotten part of what they were taught
 Thou wilt not cease to discover deceit on their part, except in a few of them
 But forgive them, and pass it over: verily, God loveth those who act generously!  And of those who say, "We are Christians," have we accepted the covenant
 But they too have forgotten a part of what they were taught; wherefore we have stirred up enmity and hatred among them that shall last till the day of the Resurrection; and in the end will God tell them of their doings
  O people of the Scriptures! now is our Apostle come to you to clear up to you much that ye concealed of those Scriptures, and to pass over many things
 Now hath a light and a clear Book come to you from God, by which God will guide him who shall follow after his good pleasure, to paths of peace, and will bring them out of the darkness to the light, by his will: and to the straight path will he guide them
  Infidels now are they who say, "Verily God is the Messiah Ibn Maryam (son of Mary)! SAY: And who could aught obtain from God, if he chose to destroy the Messiah Ibn Maryam, and his mother, and all who are on the earth together?  For with God is the sovereignty of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them! He createth what He will; and over all things is God potent
  Say the Jews and Christians, "Sons are we of God and his beloved
" SAY: Why then doth he chastise you for your sins? Nay! ye are but a part of the men whom he hath created! He will pardon whom he pleaseth, and chastise whom he pleaseth, and with God is the sovereignty of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between them, and unto Him shall all things return
  O people of the Book! now hath our Apostle come to you to clear up to you the cessation13 of Apostles, lest you should say, "There hath come to us no bearer of good tidings, nor any warner
" But now hath a bearer of good tidings and a warner reached you
 And God is Almighty
  And remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people! call to mind the goodness of God towards you when he appointed Prophets among you, and appointed you kings, and gave you what never had been given before to any human beings:  Enter, O my people! the holy land which God hath destined for you
 Turn not back, lest ye be overthrown to your ruin
"  They said, "O Moses! Therein are men of might
 And verily, we can by no means enter it till they be gone forth
 But if they go forth from it, then verily will we enter in
"  Then said two men of those who feared their Lord and to whom God had been gracious, "Enter in upon them by the gate: and when ye enter it, ye overcome! If ye be believers, put ye your trust in God
"  They said, "O Moses! never can we enter while they remain therein
 Go thou and thy Lord and fight; for here will we sit us down
"  He said, "O my Lord, Verily of none am I master but of myself and my brother: put thou therefore a difference between us and this ungodly people

 Fret not thyself therefore for the ungodly people
"  Relate to them exactly the story of the sons of Adam14 when they each offered an offering; accepted from the one of them, and not accepted from the other

  "Even if thou stretch forth thine hand against me to slay me, I will not stretch forth my hand against thee to slay thee
 Truly I fear God the Lord of the Worlds
  "Yea, rather would I that thou shouldest bear my sin15 and thine own sin, and that thou become an inmate of the Fire: for that is the recompense of the unjust doers
"  And his passion led him to slay his brother: and he slew him; and he became one of those who perish
  And God sent a raven which scratched upon the ground, to shew him16 how he might hide his brother's wrong
17 He said: "O woe is me! am I too weak to become like this raven, and to hide away my brother's wrong?" And he became one of the repentant
  For this cause have we ordained to the children of Israel that he who slayeth any one, unless it be a person guilty of manslaughter, or of spreading disorders in the land, shall be as though he had slain all mankind; but that he who saveth a life, shall be as though he had saved all mankind alive
18  Of old our Apostles came to them with the proofs of their mission; then verily after this most of them committed excesses in the land
  Only, the recompense of those who war against God and his Apostle, and go about to commit disorders on the earth, shall be that they shall be slain or crucified, or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be banished the land: This their disgrace in this world, and in the next a great torment shall be theirs-  Except those who, ere you have them in your power, shall repent; for know that God is Forgiving, Merciful
  O ye who believe! fear God
 Desire union with Him
 Contend earnestly on his path, that you may attain to happiness
  As to the infidels-if that they had twice the riches of the earth to be their ransom from torment on the day of resurrection, it should not be accepted from them! And a dolorous torment shall be their's
  Fain would they come forth from the Fire; but forth from it they shall not come: and a lasting torment shall be their's
  As to the thief, whether man or woman, cut ye off their hands in recompense for their doings
19 This is a penalty by way of warning from God himself
 And God is Mighty, Wise
  But whoever shall turn him to God after this his wickedness, and amend, God truly will be turned to him: for God is Forgiving, Merciful
  Knowest thou not that the sovereignty of the Heavens and of the Earth is God's? He chastiseth whom He will, and whom He will He forgiveth
 And God hath power over all things
  O Apostle! let not those who vie with one another in speeding to infidelity vex thee;-of those who say with their mouths, "We believe," but whose hearts believe not;-or of the Jews listeners to a lie-listeners to others-but who come not to thee
 They shift the words of the law from their places, and say, "If this be brought to you, receive it; but if this be not brought to you, then beware of it
" For him whom God would mislead, thou canst in no wise prevail with God! They whose hearts God shall not please to cleanse, shall suffer disgrace in this world, and in the next a grievous punishment;  Listeners to a falsehood and greedy devourers of the forbidden!20 If, therefore, they have recourse to thee, then judge between them, or withdraw from them
 If thou withdraw from them, then can they have no power to injure thee
 But if thou judge, then judge between them with equity
 Verily, God loveth those who deal equitably
  But how shall they make thee their judge, since they possess already the Law, in which are the behests of God, and have not obeyed it? After this, they will turn their backs; but such are not believers
  Verily, we have sent down the law (Towrat) wherein are guidance and light
 By it did the prophets who professed Islam judge the Jews; and the doctors and the teachers judged by that portion of the Book of God, of which they were the keepers and the witnesses
 Therefore, O Jews! fear not men but fear Me; and barter not away my signs for a mean price! And whoso will not judge by what God hath sent down-such are the Infidels
  And therein21 have we enacted for them, "Life for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and for wounds retaliation:"-Whoso shall compromise it as alms shall have therein the expiation of his sin; and whoso will not judge by what God hath sent down- such are the transgressors
  And in the footsteps of the prophets caused we Jesus, the son of Mary, to follow, confirming the law which was before him: and we gave him the Evangel with its guidance and light, confirmatory of the preceding Law; a guidance and warning to those who fear God;-  And that the people of the Evangel may judge according to what God hath sent down therein
 And whoso will not judge by what God hath sent down-such are the perverse
  And to thee we have sent down the Book of the Koran with truth, confirmatory of previous Scriptures, and their safeguard
 Judge therefore between them by what God hath sent down, and follow not their desires by deserting the truth which hath come unto thee
 To every one of you have we given a rule and a beaten track
  And if God had pleased He had surely made you all one people; but He would test you by what He hath given to each
 Be emulous, then, in good deeds
 To God shall ye all return, and He will tell you concerning the subjects of your disputes
  Wherefore do thou judge between them, by what God hath sent down, and follow not their wishes! but be on thy guard against them lest they beguile thee from any of those precepts which God hath sent down to thee; and if they turn back, then know thou that for some of their crimes doth God choose to punish them: for truly most men are perverse
  Desire they, therefore, the judgments of the times of(pagan) ignorance? But what better judge can there be than God for those who believe firmly?  O Believers! take not the Jews or Christians22 as friends
 They are but one another's friends
 If any one of you taketh them for his friends, he surely is one of them! God will not guide the evil doers
  So shalt thou see the diseased at heart speed away to them, and say, "We fear lest a change of fortune befall us
" But haply God will of himself bring about some victory or event of His own ordering: then soon will they repent them of their secret imaginings
  Then will the faithful say, "What! are these they who swore, by their most solemn oath, that they were surely with you?" Vain their works; and themselves shall come to ruin
  O ye who believe! should any of you desert His religion, God will then raise up a people loved by Him, and loving Him, lowly towards the faithful, haughty towards the Infidels
 For the cause of God will they contend, and not fear the blame of the blamer
 This is the Grace of God! On whom He will He bestoweth it! God is Vast, Omniscient!  Verily, your protector is God and His Apostle, and those who believe, who observe prayer, and pay the alms of obligation, and who bow in worship
  And whoso take God and His Apostle, and those who believe for friends, they truly are the people of God; they shall have the upper hand
  O ye who believe! take not such of those who have received the Scriptures before you, as scoff and jest at your religion, or the Infidels, for your friends, but fear God if ye are believers:  Nor those who when ye call to prayer, make it an object of raillery and derision
 This they do because they are a people who understand not
  SAY:23 O people of the Book! do ye not disavow us only because we believe in God, and in what He hath sent down to us, and in what He hath sent down aforetime, and because most of you are doers of ill?  SAY: Can I announce to you any retribution worse than that which awaiteth them with God? They whom God hath cursed and with whom He hath been angry- some of them hath He changed into apes and swine; and they who worship Thagout are in evil plight, and have gone far astray from the right path!  When they presented themselves to you they said, "We believe;" but Infidels they came in unto you, and Infidels they went forth! God well knew what they concealed
  Many of them shalt thou see hastening together to wickedness and malice, and to eat unlawful things
 Shame on them for what they have done!  Had not their doctors and teachers forbidden their uttering wickedness, and their eating unlawful food, bad indeed would have been their doings!  "The hand of God," say the Jews, "is chained up
"24 Their own hands shall be chained up-and for that which they have said shall they be cursed
 Nay! outstretched are both His hands! At His own pleasure does He bestow gifts
 That which hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase the rebellion and unbelief of many of them; and we have put enmity and hatred between them that shall last till the day of the Resurrection
 Oft as they kindle a beacon fire for war shall God quench it! and their aim will be to abet disorder on the earth: but God loveth not the abettors of disorder
  But if the people of the Book believe and have the fear of God, we will surely put away their sins from them, and will bring them into gardens of delight: and if that they observe the law and the Evangel, and what hath been sent down to them from their Lord, they shall surely have their fill of good things from above them and from beneath their feet
 Some there are among them who act aright; but many of them-how evil are their doings!  O Apostle! proclaim all that hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord: for if thou do it not, thou hast not proclaimed His message at all
 And God will protect thee from evil men: verily, God guideth not the unbelievers
  SAY: O people of the Book! ye have no ground to stand on, until ye observe the Law and the Evangel, and that which hath been sent down to you from your Lord
25 The Book which hath been sent down to thee from thy Lord will certainly increase the rebellion and unbelief of many of them; but, be not thou troubled for the unbelievers
  Verily, they who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabeites,26 and the Christians-whoever of them believeth in God and in the last day, and doth what is right, on them shall come no fear, neither shall they be put to grief
  Of old we accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, and sent Apostles to them
 Oft as an Apostle came to them with that for which they had no desire, some they treated as liars, and some they slew;27  And they reckoned that no harm would come of it:-but they became blind and deaf! Then was God turned unto them: then many of them again became blind and deaf! but God beheld what they did
  Infidels now are they who say, "God is the Messiah, Son of Mary;" for the Messiah said, "O children of Israel! worship God, my Lord and your Lord
" Whoever shall join other gods with God, God shall forbid him the Garden, and his abode shall be the Fire; and the wicked shall have no helpers
  They surely are Infidels who say, "God is the third of three:" for there is no God but one God: and if they refrain not from what they say, a grievous chastisement shall light on such of them as are Infidels
  Will they not, therefore, be turned unto God, and ask pardon of Him? since God is Forgiving, Merciful!  The Messiah, Son of Mary, is but an Apostle; other Apostles have flourished before him; and his mother was a just28 person: they both ate food
29 Behold! how we make clear to them the signs! then behold how they turn aside!  SAY: Will ye worship, beside God, that which can neither hurt nor help? But God! He only Heareth, Knoweth
  SAY: O people of the Book! outstep not bounds of truth in your religion; neither follow the desires of those who have already gone astray, and who have caused many to go astray, and have themselves gone astray from the evenness of the way
  Those among the children of Israel who believed not were cursed by the tongue of David,30 and of Jesus, Son of Mary
 This, because they were rebellious, and became transgressors: they forbade not one another the iniquity which they wrought! detestable are their actions!  Thou shalt see many of them make friends of the infidels
 Evil the actions which their own passions have sent on beforehand; for God is angry with them, and in torment shall they abide for ever:  But, if they had believed in God, and the Prophet, and the Koran which hath been sent down to him, they had not taken them for their friends; but perverse are most of them
  Of all men thou wilt certainly find the Jews, and those who join other gods with God, to be the most intense in hatred of those who believe; and thou shalt certainly find those to be nearest in affection to them who say, "We are Christians
" This, because some of them are priests and monks,31 and because they are free from pride
  And when they hear that which hath been sent down to the Apostle, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears at the truth they recognise therein, saying, "O our Lord! we believe; write us down therefore with those who bear witness to it
  And why should we not believe in God, and in the truth which hath come down to us, and crave that our Lord would bring us into Paradise with the Just?"  Therefore hath God rewarded them for these their words, with gardens 'neath which the rivers flow; they shall abide therein for ever: this the reward of the righteous! But they who believe not and treat our signs as lies shall be the inmates of Hell-fire
  O ye who believe! interdict not the healthful viands which God hath allowed you; go not beyond this limit
 God loveth not those who outstep it
32  And eat of what God hath given you for food, that which is lawful and wholesome: and fear God, in whom ye believe
  God will not punish you for a mistaken word in your oaths: but he will punish you in regard to an oath taken seriously
33 Its expiation shall be to feed ten poor persons with such middling food as ye feed your own families with, or to clothe them; or to set free a captive
 But he who cannot find means, shall fast three days
 This is the expiation of your oaths when ye shall have sworn
 Keep then your oaths
 Thus God maketh his signs clear to you, that ye may give thanks
  O believers! surely wine and games of chance,34 and statues, and the divining arrows, are an abomination of Satan's work! Avoid them, that ye may prosper
  Only would Satan sow hatred and strife among you, by wine and games of chance, and turn you aside from the remembrance of God, and from prayer: will ye not, therefore, abstain from them? Obey God and obey the Apostle, and be on your guard: but if ye turn back, know that our Apostle is only bound to deliver a plain announcement
  No blame shall attach to those who believe and do good works, in regard to any food they have taken, in case they fear God and believe, and do the things that are right, and shall still fear God and believe, and shall still fear him, and do good; for God loveth those who do good
  O ye who believe! God will surely make trial of you with such game as ye may take with your hands, or your lances, that God may know who feareth him in secret: and whoever after this transgresseth, shall suffer a grievous chastisement
  O believers!35 kill no game while ye are on pilgrimage
 Whosoever among you shall purposely kill it, shall comsent pensate for it in domestic animals of equal value (according to the judgment of two just persons among you), to be brought as an offering to the Caaba; or in expiation thereof shall feed the poor; or as the equivalent of this shall fast, that he may taste the ill consequence of his deed
 God forgiveth what is past; but whoever doth it again, God will take vengeance on him; for God is mighty and vengeance is His
  It is lawful for you to fish in the sea, and to eat fish, as provision for you and for those who travel; but it is unlawful for you to hunt by land while ye are still on pilgrimage: fear ye God, therefore, before whom ye shall be assembled
  God hath appointed the Caaba,36 the sacred house, to be a station for mankind, and the sacred month, and the offering, and its ornaments
 This, that ye may know that God knoweth all that is in the heavens and on the earth, and that God hath knowledge of everything
 Know that God is severe in punishing, and that God is Forgiving, Merciful
  The Apostle is only bound to preach: and God knoweth what ye bring to light, and what ye conceal
  SAY: The evil and the good shall not be valued alike, even though the abundance of evil please thee; therefore fear God, O ye of understanding! that it may be well with you
  O believers! ask us not of things which if they were told might only pain you; but if ye ask of such things when the entire Koran shall have been sent down, they will be declared to you: God will pardon you for this, for God is Forgiving, Gracious
 They who were before you, asked concerning such things, and afterwards quickly disbelieved therein  God hath not ordained anything on the subject
 of Bahira, or Saïba, or Wasila, or Hami;37 but the unbelievers have invented this lie against God: and most of them had no understanding
  And when it was said to them, "Accede to that which God hath sent down, and to the Apostle:" they said, "Sufficient for us is the faith in which we found our fathers
" What! though their fathers knew nothing, and had no guidance?  O believers! take heed to yourselves
38 He who erreth shall not hurt you when ye have the "guidance:" to God shall ye all return, and He will tell you that which ye have done
  O believers! let there be witnesses between you, when death draweth nigh to any of you, at the time of making the testament; two witnesses-just men from among yourselves, or two others of a different tribe from yourselves-if ye be journeying in the earth, and the calamity of death surprise you
 Ye shall shut them both up, after the prayer; and if ye doubt them, they shall swear by God, "We will not take a bribe though the party be of kin to us, neither will we conceal the testimony of God, for then we should be among the wicked
"  But if it shall be made clear that both have been guilty of a falsehood, two others of those who have convicted them thereof, the two nearest in blood shall stand up in their place, and they shall swear by God, "Verily our witness is more true than the witness of these two; neither have we advanced anything untrue, for then should we be of the unjust
"  Thus will it be easier for men to bear a true39 witness, or fear lest after their oath another oath be given
 Therefore fear God and hearken; for God guideth not the perverse
  One day will God assemble the Apostles, and say, "What reply was made to you?" They shall say, "We have no knowledge, but Thou art the Knower of Secrets
"  When He shall say: O Jesus! Son of Mary! call to mind my favour upon thee and upon thy mother, when I strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit, that thou shouldest speak40 to men alike in the cradle, and when grown up;-  And when I taught thee the Scripture, and Wisdom, and the Law, and the Evangel: and thou didst create of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by my leave, and didst breathe into it, and by my leave it became a bird; and thou didst heal the blind and the leper, by my leave; and when, by my leave, thou didst bring forth the dead; and when I withheld the children of Israel from thee, when thou hadst come to them with clear tokens: and such of them as believed not said, "This is nought but plain sorcery;"41  And when I revealed unto the Apostles, "Believe on me and on my Sent One," they said, "We believe; and bear thou witness that we are Muslims
"  Remember when the Apostles42 said-"O Jesus, Son of Mary! is thy Lord able to send down a furnished TABLE to us out of Heaven?" He said-"Fear God if ye be believers
"  They said-"We desire to eat therefrom, and to have our hearts assured; and to know that thou hast indeed spoken truth to us, and to be witnesses thereof
"  Jesus, Son of Mary, said-"O God, our Lord! send down a table to us out of Heaven, that it may become a recurring festival to us, to the first of us and to the last of us, and a sign from thee; and do thou nourish us, for thou art the best of nourishers
"  And God said-Verily, I will cause it to descend unto you; but whoever among you after that shall disbelieve, I will surely chastise him with a chastisement, wherewith I will not chastise any other creature
43  And when God shall say-"O Jesus, Son of Mary: hast thou said unto mankind- 'Take me and my mother as two Gods, beside God?"' He shall say-"Glory be unto Thee! it is not for me to say that which I know to be not the truth; had I said that, verily thou wouldest have known it: Thou knowest what is in me, but I know not what is in Thee; for Thou well knowest things unseen!  "I spake not to them aught but that which thou didst bid me-'Worship God, my Lord and your Lord;' and I was a witness of their actions while I stayed among them; but since thou hast taken me to Thyself, Thou hast Thyself watched them, and Thou art witness of all things:  "If Thou punish them, they are Thy servants, and if Thou forgive them
 
 
 
44 Thou, verily, art the Mighty, the Wise!"  God will say-This day shall their truth advantage the truthful
 Gardens shall they have 'neath which the rivers flow, and remain therein for ever: God is well pleased with them and they with Him
 This shall be the great bliss
  Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that they contain; and He hath power over all things

PREFACE   One of the current objections to Communism, and Socialism altogether, is that the idea is so old, and yet it has never been realized
 Schemes of ideal States haunted the thinkers of Ancient Greece; later on, the early Christians joined in communist groups; centuries later, large communist brotherhoods came into existence during the Reform movement
 Then, the same ideals were revived during the great English and French Revolutions; and finally, quite lately, in 1848, a revolution, inspired to a great extent with Socialist ideals, took place in France
 "And yet, you see," we are told, "how far away is still the realization of your schemes
 Don't you think that there is some fundamental error in your understanding of human nature and its needs?"  At first sight this objection seems very serious
 However, the moment we consider human history more attentively, it loses its strength
 We see, first, that hundreds of millions of men have succeeded in maintaining amongst themselves, in their village communities, for many hundreds of years, one of the main elements of Socialism--the common ownership of the chief instrument of production, the land, and the apportionment of the same according to the labour capacities of the different families; and we learn that if the communal possession of the land has been destroyed in Western Europe, it was not from within, but from without, by the governments which created a land monopoly in favour of the nobility and the middle classes
 We learn, moreover, that the medieval cities succeeded in maintaining in their midst, for several centuries in succession, a certain socialized organization of production and trade; that these centuries were periods of a rapid intellectual, industrial, and artistic progress; while the decay of these communal institutions came mainly from the incapacity of men of combining the village with the city, the peasant with the citizen, so as jointly to oppose the growth of the military states, which destroyed the free cities
  The history of mankind, thus understood, does not offer, then, an argument against Communism
 It appears, on the contrary, as a succession of endeavours to realize some sort of communist organization, endeavours which were crowned here and there with a partial success of a certain duration; and all we are authorized to conclude is, that mankind has not yet found the proper form for combining, on communistic principles, agriculture with a suddenly developed industry and a rapidly growing international trade
 The latter appears especially as a disturbing element, since it is no longer individuals only, or cities, that enrich themselves by distant commerce and export; but whole nations grow rich at the cost of those nations which lag behind in their industrial development
  These conditions, which began to appear by the end of the eighteenth century, took, however, their full development in the nineteenth century only, after the Napoleonic wars came to an end
 And modern Communism has to take them into account
  It is now known that the French Revolution, apart from its political significance, was an attempt made by the French people, in 1793 and 1794, in three different directions more or less akin to Socialism
 It was, first, _the equalization of fortunes_, by means of an income tax and succession duties, both heavily progressive, as also by a direct confiscation of the land in order to sub-divide it, and by heavy war taxes levied upon the rich only
 The second attempt was a sort of _Municipal Communism_ as regards the consumption of some objects of first necessity, bought by the municipalities, and sold by them at cost price
 And the third attempt was to introduce a wide _national system of rationally established prices of all commodities_, for which the real cost of production and moderate trade profits had to be taken into account
 The Convention worked hard at this scheme, and had nearly completed its work, when reaction took the upper hand
  It was during this remarkable movement, which has never yet been properly studied, that modern Socialism was born--Fourierism with L'Ange, at Lyons, and authoritarian Communism with Buonarroti, Babeuf, and their comrades
 And it was immediately after the Great Revolution that the three great theoretical founders of modern Socialism--Fourier, Saint Simon, and Robert Owen, as well as Godwin (the No-State Socialism)--came forward; while the secret communist societies, originated from those of Buonarroti and Babeuf, gave their stamp to militant, authoritarian Communism for the next fifty years
  To be correct, then, we must say that modern Socialism is not yet a hundred years old, and that, for the first half of these hundred years, two nations only, which stood at the head of the industrial movement, i
e
, Britain and France, took part in its elaboration
 Both--bleeding at that time from the terrible wounds inflicted upon them by fifteen years of Napoleonic wars, and both enveloped in the great European reaction that had come from the East
  In fact, it was only after the Revolution of July, 1830, in France, and the Reform movement of 1830-1832 in this country, had begun to shake off that terrible reaction, that the discussion of Socialism became possible for a few years before the revolution of 1848
 And it was during those years that the aspirations of Fourier, St
 Simon, and Robert Owen, worked out by their followers, took a definite shape, and the different schools of Socialism which exist nowadays were defined
  In Britain, Robert Owen and his followers worked out their schemes of communist villages, agricultural and industrial at the same time; immense co-operative associations were started for creating with their dividends more communist colonies; and the Great Consolidated Trades' Union was founded--the forerunner of both the Labour Parties of our days and the International Working-men's Association
  In France, the Fourierist Considérant issued his remarkable manifesto, which contains, beautifully developed, all the theoretical considerations upon the growth of Capitalism, which are now described as "Scientific Socialism
" Proudhon worked out his idea of Anarchism and Mutualism, without State interference
 Louis Blanc published his _Organization of Labour_, which became later on the programme of Lassalle
 Vidal in France and Lorenz Stein in Germany further developed, in two remarkable works, published in 1846 and 1847 respectively, the theoretical conceptions of Considérant; and finally Vidal, and especially Pecqueur, developed in detail the system of Collectivism, which the former wanted the National Assembly of 1848 to vote in the shape of laws
  However, there is one feature, common to all Socialist schemes of that period, which must be noted
 The three great founders of Socialism who wrote at the dawn of the nineteenth century were so entranced by the wide horizons which it opened before them, that they looked upon it as a new revelation, and upon themselves as upon the founders of a new religion
 Socialism had to be a religion, and they had to regulate its march, as the heads of a new church
 Besides, writing during the period of reaction which had followed the French Revolution, and seeing more its failures than its successes, they did not trust the masses, and they did not appeal to them for bringing about the changes which they thought necessary
 They put their faith, on the contrary, into some great ruler, some Socialist Napoleon
 He would understand the new revelation; he would be convinced of its desirability by the successful experiments of their phalansteries, or associations; and he would peacefully accomplish by his own authority the revolution which would bring well-being and happiness to mankind
 A military genius, Napoleon, had just been ruling Europe
 Why should not a social genius come forward, carry Europe with him and translate the new Gospel into life? That faith was rooted very deep, and it stood for a long time in the way of Socialism; its traces are even seen amongst us, down to the present day
  It was only during the years 1840-48, when the approach of the Revolution was felt everywhere, and the proletarians were beginning to plant the banner of Socialism on the barricades, that faith in the people began to enter once more the hearts of the social schemers: faith, on the one side, in Republican Democracy, and on the other side in _free_ association, in the organizing powers of the working-men themselves
  But then came the Revolution of February, 1848, the middle-class Republic, and--with it, shattered hopes
 Four months only after the proclamation of the Republic, the June insurrection of the Paris proletarians broke out, and it was crushed in blood
 The wholesale shooting of the working-men, the mass deportations to New Guinea, and finally the Napoleonian _coup d'êtat_ followed
 The Socialists were prosecuted with fury, and the weeding out was so terrible and so thorough that for the next twelve or fifteen years the very traces of Socialism disappeared; its literature vanished so completely that even names, once so familiar before 1848, were entirely forgotten; ideas which were then current--the stock ideas of the Socialists before 1848--were so wiped out as to be taken, later on, by our generation, for new discoveries
  However, when a new revival began, about 1866, when Communism and Collectivism once more came forward, it appeared that the conception as to the means of their realization had undergone a deep change
 The old faith in Political Democracy was dying out, and the first principles upon which the Paris working-men agreed with the British trade-unionists and Owenites, when they met in 1862 and 1864, at London, was that "the emancipation of the working-men must be accomplished by the working-men themselves
" Upon another point they also were agreed
 It was that the labour unions themselves would have to get hold of the instruments of production, and organize production themselves
 The French idea of the Fourierist and Mutualist "Association" thus joined hands with Robert Owen's idea of "The Great Consolidated Trades' Union," which was extended now, so as to become an International Working-men's Association
  Again this new revival of Socialism lasted but a few years
 Soon came the war of 1870-71, the uprising of the Paris Commune--and again the free development of Socialism was rendered impossible in France
 But while Germany accepted now from the hands of its German teachers, Marx and Engels, the Socialism of the French "forty-eighters" that is, the Socialism of Considérant and Louis Blanc, and the Collectivism of Pecqueur,--France made a further step forward
  In March, 1871, Paris had proclaimed that henceforward it would not wait for the retardatory portions of France: that it intended to start within its Commune its own social development
  The movement was too short-lived to give any positive result
 It remained communalist only; it merely asserted the rights of the Commune to its full autonomy
 But the working-classes of the old International saw at once its historical significance
 They understood that the free commune would be henceforth the medium in which the ideas of modern Socialism may come to realization
 The free agro-industrial communes, of which so much was spoken in England and France before 1848, need not be small phalansteries, or small communities of 2000 persons
 They must be vast agglomerations, like Paris, or, still better, small territories
 These communes would federate to constitute nations in some cases, even irrespectively of the present national frontiers (like the Cinque Ports, or the Hansa)
 At the same time large labour associations would come into existence for the inter-communal service of the railways, the docks, and so on
  Such were the ideas which began vaguely to circulate after 1871 amongst the thinking working-men, especially in the Latin countries
 In some such organization, the details of which life itself would settle, the labour circles saw the medium through which Socialist forms of life could find a much easier realization than through the seizure of all industrial property by the State, and the State organization of agriculture and industry
  These are the ideas to which I have endeavoured to give a more or less definite expression in this book
  Looking back now at the years that have passed since this book was written, I can say in full conscience that its leading ideas must have been correct
 State Socialism has certainly made considerable progress
 State railways, State banking, and State trade in spirits have been introduced here and there
 But every step made in this direction, even though it resulted in the cheapening of a given commodity, was found to be a new obstacle in the struggle of the working-men for their emancipation
 So that we find growing amongst the working-men, especially in Western Europe, the idea that even the working of such a vast national property as a railway-net could be much better handled by a Federated Union of railway employés, than by a State organization
  On the other side, we see that countless attempts have been made all over Europe and America, the leading idea of which is, on the one side, to get into the hands of the working-men themselves wide branches of production, and, on the other side, to always widen in the cities the circles of the functions which the city performs in the interest of its inhabitants
 Trade-unionism, with a growing tendency towards organizing the different trades internationally, and of being not only an instrument for the improvement of the conditions of labour, but also of becoming an organization which might, at a given moment, take into its hands the management of production; Co-operation, both for production and for distribution, both in industry and agriculture, and attempts at combining both sorts of co-operation in experimental colonies; and finally, the immensely varied field of the so-called Municipal Socialism--these are the three directions in which the greatest amount of creative power has been developed lately
  Of course, none of these may, in any degree, be taken as a substitute for Communism, or even for Socialism, both of which imply the common possession of the instruments of production
 But we certainly must look at all these attempts as upon _experiments_--like those which Owen, Fourier, and Saint Simon tried in their colonies--experiments which prepare human thought to conceive some of the practical forms in which a communist society might find its expression
 The synthesis of all these partial experiments will have to be made some day by the constructive genius of some one of the civilized nations
 But samples of the bricks out of which the great synthetic building will have to be built, and even samples of some of its rooms, are being prepared by the immense effort of the constructive genius of man
    BRIGHTON
       _January, 1913
_     THE CONQUEST OF BREAD     CHAPTER I  OUR RICHES   I  The human race has travelled a long way, since those remote ages when men fashioned their rude implements of flint and lived on the precarious spoils of hunting, leaving to their children for their only heritage a shelter beneath the rocks, some poor utensils--and Nature, vast, unknown, and terrific, with whom they had to fight for their wretched existence
  During the long succession of agitated ages which have elapsed since, mankind has nevertheless amassed untold treasures
 It has cleared the land, dried the marshes, hewn down forests, made roads, pierced mountains; it has been building, inventing, observing, reasoning; it has created a complex machinery, wrested her secrets from Nature, and finally it pressed steam and electricity into its service
 And the result is, that now the child of the civilized man finds at its birth, ready for its use, an immense capital accumulated by those who have gone before him
 And this capital enables man to acquire, merely by his own labour combined with the labour of others, riches surpassing the dreams of the fairy tales of the Thousand and One Nights
  The soil is cleared to a great extent, fit for the reception of the best seeds, ready to give a rich return for the skill and labour spent upon it--a return more than sufficient for all the wants of humanity
 The methods of rational cultivation are known
  On the wide prairies of America each hundred men, with the aid of powerful machinery, can produce in a few months enough wheat to maintain ten thousand people for a whole year
 And where man wishes to double his produce, to treble it, to multiply it a hundred-fold, he _makes_ the soil, gives to each plant the requisite care, and thus obtains enormous returns
 While the hunter of old had to scour fifty or sixty square miles to find food for his family, the civilized man supports his household, with far less pains, and far more certainty, on a thousandth part of that space
 Climate is no longer an obstacle
 When the sun fails, man replaces it by artificial heat; and we see the coming of a time when artificial light also will be used to stimulate vegetation
 Meanwhile, by the use of glass and hot water pipes, man renders a given space ten and fifty times more productive than it was in its natural state
  The prodigies accomplished in industry are still more striking
 With the co-operation of those intelligent beings, modern machines--themselves the fruit of three or four generations of inventors, mostly unknown--a hundred men manufacture now the stuff to provide ten thousand persons with clothing for two years
 In well-managed coal mines the labour of a hundred miners furnishes each year enough fuel to warm ten thousand families under an inclement sky
 And we have lately witnessed the spectacle of wonderful cities springing up in a few months for international exhibitions, without interrupting in the slightest degree the regular work of the nations
  And if in manufactures as in agriculture, and as indeed through our whole social system, the labour, the discoveries, and the inventions of our ancestors profit chiefly the few, it is none the less certain that mankind in general, aided by the creatures of steel and iron which it already possesses, could already procure an existence of wealth and ease for every one of its members
  Truly, we are rich--far richer than we think; rich in what we already possess, richer still in the possibilities of production of our actual mechanical outfit; richest of all in what we might win from our soil, from our manufactures, from our science, from our technical knowledge, were they but applied to bringing about the well-being of all
   II  In our civilized societies we are rich
 Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?  The Socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly
 Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences
 It is because all that is necessary for production--the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge--all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature
 It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate to-day two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way
 It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion's share
 It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists
 In this is the substance of all Socialism
  Take, indeed, a civilized country
 The forests which once covered it have been cleared, the marshes drained, the climate improved
 It has been made habitable
 The soil, which bore formerly only a coarse vegetation, is covered to-day with rich harvests
 The rock-walls in the valleys are laid out in terraces and covered with vines
 The wild plants, which yielded nought but acrid berries, or uneatable roots, have been transformed by generations of culture into succulent vegetables or trees covered with delicious fruits
 Thousands of highways and railroads furrow the earth, and pierce the mountains
 The shriek of the engine is heard in the wild gorges of the Alps, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas
 The rivers have been made navigable; the coasts, carefully surveyed, are easy of access; artificial harbours, laboriously dug out and protected against the fury of the sea, afford shelter to the ships
 Deep shafts have been sunk in the rocks; labyrinths of underground galleries have been dug out where coal may be raised or minerals extracted
 At the crossings of the highways great cities have sprung up, and within their borders all the treasures of industry, science, and art have been accumulated
  Whole generations, that lived and died in misery, oppressed and ill-treated by their masters, and worn out by toil, have handed on this immense inheritance to our century
  For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the forests, to drain the marshes, and to open up highways by land and water
 Every rood of soil we cultivate in Europe has been watered by the sweat of several races of men
 Every acre has its story of enforced labour, of intolerable toil, of the people's sufferings
 Every mile of railway, every yard of tunnel, has received its share of human blood
  The shafts of the mine still bear on their rocky walls the marks made by the pick of the workman who toiled to excavate them
 The space between each prop in the underground galleries might be marked as a miner's grave; and who can tell what each of these graves has cost, in tears, in privations, in unspeakable wretchedness to the family who depended on the scanty wage of the worker cut off in his prime by fire-damp, rock-fall, or flood?  The cities, bound together by railroads and waterways, are organisms which have lived through centuries
 Dig beneath them and you find, one above another, the foundations of streets, of houses, of theatres, of public buildings
 Search into their history and you will see how the civilization of the town, its industry, its special characteristics, have slowly grown and ripened through the co-operation of generations of its inhabitants before it could become what it is to-day
 And even to-day, the value of each dwelling, factory, and warehouse, which has been created by the accumulated labour of the millions of workers, now dead and buried, is only maintained by the very presence and labour of legions of the men who now inhabit that special corner of the globe
 Each of the atoms composing what we call the Wealth of Nations owes its value to the fact that it is a part of the great whole
 What would a London dockyard or a great Paris warehouse be if they were not situated in these great centres of international commerce? What would become of our mines, our factories, our workshops, and our railways, without the immense quantities of merchandise transported every day by sea and land?  Millions of human beings have laboured to create this civilization on which we pride ourselves to-day
 Other millions, scattered through the globe, labour to maintain it
 Without them nothing would be left in fifty years but ruins
  There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not common property, born of the past and the present
 Thousands of inventors, known and unknown, who have died in poverty, have co-operated in the invention of each of these machines which embody the genius of man
  Thousands of writers, of poets, of scholars, have laboured to increase knowledge, to dissipate error, and to create that atmosphere of scientific thought, without which the marvels of our century could never have appeared
 And these thousands of philosophers, of poets, of scholars, of inventors, have themselves been supported by the labour of past centuries
 They have been upheld and nourished through life, both physically and mentally, by legions of workers and craftsmen of all sorts
 They have drawn their motive force from the environment
  The genius of a Séguin, a Mayer, a Grove, has certainly done more to launch industry in new directions than all the capitalists in the world
 But men of genius are themselves the children of industry as well as of science
 Not until thousands of steam-engines had been working for years before all eyes, constantly transforming heat into dynamic force, and this force into sound, light, and electricity, could the insight of genius proclaim the mechanical origin and the unity of the physical forces
 And if we, children of the nineteenth century, have at last grasped this idea, if we know now how to apply it, it is again because daily experience has prepared the way
 The thinkers of the eighteenth century saw and declared it, but the idea remained undeveloped, because the eighteenth century had not grown up like ours, side by side with the steam-engine
 Imagine the decades that might have passed while we remained in ignorance of this law, which has revolutionized modern industry, had Watt not found at Soho skilled workmen to embody his ideas in metal, bringing all the parts of his engine to perfection, so that steam, pent in a complete mechanism, and rendered more docile than a horse, more manageable than water, became at last the very soul of modern industry
  Every machine has had the same history--a long record of sleepless nights and of poverty, of disillusions and of joys, of partial improvements discovered by several generations of nameless workers, who have added to the original invention these little nothings, without which the most fertile idea would remain fruitless
 More than that: every new invention is a synthesis, the resultant of innumerable inventions which have preceded it in the vast field of mechanics and industry
  Science and industry, knowledge and application, discovery and practical realization leading to new discoveries, cunning of brain and of hand, toil of mind and muscle--all work together
 Each discovery, each advance, each increase in the sum of human riches, owes its being to the physical and mental travail of the past and the present
  By what right then can any one whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say--This is mine, not yours?   III  It has come about, however, in the course of the ages traversed by the human race, that all that enables man to produce and to increase his power of production has been seized by the few
 Some time, perhaps, we will relate how this came to pass
 For the present let it suffice to state the fact and analyze its consequences
  To-day the soil, which actually owes its value to the needs of an ever-increasing population, belongs to a minority who prevent the people from cultivating it--or do not allow them to cultivate it according to modern methods
  The mines, though they represent the labour of several generations, and derive their sole value from the requirements of the industry of a nation and the density of the population--the mines also belong to the few; and these few restrict the output of coal, or prevent it entirely, if they find more profitable investments for their capital
 Machinery, too, has become the exclusive property of the few, and even when a machine incontestably represents the improvements added to the original rough invention by three or four generations of workers, it none the less belongs to a few owners
 And if the descendants of the very inventor who constructed the first machine for lace-making, a century ago, were to present themselves to-day in a lace factory at Bâle or Nottingham, and claim their rights, they would be told: "Hands off! this machine is not yours," and they would be shot down if they attempted to take possession of it
  The railways, which would be useless as so much old iron without the teeming population of Europe, its industry, its commerce, and its marts, belong to a few shareholders, ignorant perhaps of the whereabouts of the lines of rails which yield them revenues greater than those of medieval kings
 And if the children of those who perished by thousands while excavating the railway cuttings and tunnels were to assemble one day, crowding in their rags and hunger, to demand bread from the shareholders, they would be met with bayonets and grapeshot, to disperse them and safeguard "vested interests
"  In virtue of this monstrous system, the son of the worker, on entering life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master
 He must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage
 His father and his grandfather have toiled to drain this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine
 They gave to the work the full measure of their strength, and what more could they give? But their heir comes into the world poorer than the lowest savage
 If he obtains leave to till the fields, it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of the produce to his master, and another quarter to the government and the middlemen
 And this tax, levied upon him by the State, the capitalist, the lord of the manor, and the middleman, is always increasing; it rarely leaves him the power to improve his system of culture
 If he turns to industry, he is allowed to work--though not always even that--only on condition that he yield a half or two-thirds of the product to him whom the land recognizes as the owner of the machine
  We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop
 We called those the barbarous times
 But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations
 For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions
 Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger
  The result of this state of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction
 Enterprise takes no thought for the needs of the community
 Its only aim is to increase the gains of the speculator
 Hence the constant fluctuations of trade, the periodical industrial crises, each of which throws scores of thousands of workers on the streets
  The working people cannot purchase with their wages the wealth which they have produced, and industry seeks foreign markets among the monied classes of other nations
 In the East, in Africa, everywhere, in Egypt, Tonkin or the Congo, the European is thus bound to promote the growth of serfdom
 And so he does
 But soon he finds that everywhere there are similar competitors
 All the nations evolve on the same lines, and wars, perpetual wars, break out for the right of precedence in the market
 Wars for the possession of the East, wars for the empire of the sea, wars to impose duties on imports and to dictate conditions to neighbouring states; wars against those "blacks" who revolt! The roar of the cannon never ceases in the world, whole races are massacred, the states of Europe spend a third of their budgets in armaments; and we know how heavily these taxes fall on the workers
  Education still remains the privilege of a small minority, for it is idle to talk of education when the workman's child is forced, at the age of thirteen, to go down into the mine or to help his father on the farm
 It is idle to talk of studying to the worker, who comes home in the evening wearied by excessive toil, and its brutalizing atmosphere
 Society is thus bound to remain divided into two hostile camps, and in such conditions freedom is a vain word
 The Radical begins by demanding a greater extension of political rights, but he soon sees that the breath of liberty leads to the uplifting of the proletariat, and then he turns round, changes his opinions, and reverts to repressive legislation and government by the sword
  A vast array of courts, judges, executioners, policemen, and gaolers is needed to uphold these privileges; and this array gives rise in its turn to a whole system of espionage, of false witness, of spies, of threats and corruption
  The system under which we live checks in its turn the growth of the social sentiment
 We all know that without uprightness, without self-respect, without sympathy and mutual aid, human kind must perish, as perish the few races of animals living by rapine, or the slave-keeping ants
 But such ideas are not to the taste of the ruling classes, and they have elaborated a whole system of pseudo-science to teach the contrary
  Fine sermons have been preached on the text that those who have should share with those who have not, but he who would carry out this principle would be speedily informed that these beautiful sentiments are all very well in poetry, but not in practice
 "To lie is to degrade and besmirch oneself," we say, and yet all civilized life becomes one huge lie
 We accustom ourselves and our children to hypocrisy, to the practice of a double-faced morality
 And since the brain is ill at ease among lies, we cheat ourselves with sophistry
 Hypocrisy and sophistry become the second nature of the civilized man
  But a society cannot live thus; it must return to truth, or cease to exist
  Thus the consequences which spring from the original act of monopoly spread through the whole of social life
 Under pain of death, human societies are forced to return to first principles: the means of production being the collective work of humanity, the product should be the collective property of the race
 Individual appropriation is neither just nor serviceable
 All belongs to all
 All things are for all men, since all men have need of them, since all men have worked in the measure of their strength to produce them, and since it is not possible to evaluate every one's part in the production of the world's wealth
  All things for all
 Here is an immense stock of tools and implements; here are all those iron slaves which we call machines, which saw and plane, spin and weave for us, unmaking and remaking, working up raw matter to produce the marvels of our time
 But nobody has the right to seize a single one of these machines and say: "This is mine; if you want to use it you must pay me a tax on each of your products," any more than the feudal lord of medieval times had the right to say to the peasant: "This hill, this meadow belong to me, and you must pay me a tax on every sheaf of corn you reap, on every brick you build
"  All is for all! If the man and the woman bear their fair share of work, they have a right to their fair share of all that is produced by all, and that share is enough to secure them well-being
 No more of such vague formulas as "The right to work," or "To each the whole result of his labour
" What we proclaim is THE RIGHT TO WELL-BEING: WELL-BEING FOR ALL!     CHAPTER II  WELL-BEING FOR ALL   I  Well-being for all is not a dream
 It is possible, realizable, owing to all that our ancestors have done to increase our powers of production
  We know, indeed, that the producers, although they constitute hardly one-third of the inhabitants of civilized countries, even now produce such quantities of goods that a certain degree of comfort could be brought to every hearth
 We know further that if all those who squander to-day the fruits of others' toil were forced to employ their leisure in useful work, our wealth would increase in proportion to the number of producers, and more
 Finally, we know that contrary to the theory enunciated by Malthus--that Oracle of middle-class Economics--the productive powers of the human race increase at a much more rapid ratio than its powers of reproduction
 The more thickly men are crowded on the soil, the more rapid is the growth of their wealth-creating power
  Thus, although the population of England has only increased from 1844 to 1890 by 62 per cent
, its production has grown, even at the lowest estimate, at double that rate--to wit, by 130 per cent
 In France, where the population has grown more slowly, the increase in production is nevertheless very rapid
 Notwithstanding the crises through which agriculture is frequently passing, notwithstanding State interference, the blood-tax (conscription), and speculative commerce and finance, the production of wheat in France has increased four-fold, and industrial production more than tenfold, in the course of the last eighty years
 In the United States this progress is still more striking
 In spite of immigration, or rather precisely because of the influx of surplus European labour, the United States have multiplied their wealth tenfold
  However, these figures give but a very faint idea of what our wealth might become under better conditions
 For alongside of the rapid development of our wealth-producing powers we have an overwhelming increase in the ranks of the idlers and middlemen
 Instead of capital gradually concentrating itself in a few hands, so that it would only be necessary for the community to dispossess a few millionaires and enter upon its lawful heritage--instead of this Socialist forecast proving true, the exact reverse is coming to pass: the swarm of parasites is ever increasing
  In France there are not ten actual producers to every thirty inhabitants
 The whole agricultural wealth of the country is the work of less than seven millions of men, and in the two great industries, mining and the textile trades, you will find that the workers number less than two and one-half millions
 But the exploiters of labour, how many are they? In the United Kingdom a little over one million workers--men, women, and children, are employed in all the textile trades; less than nine hundred thousand work the mines; much less than two million till the ground, and it appeared from the last industrial census that only a little over four million men, women and children were employed in all the industries
[1] So that the statisticians have to exaggerate all the figures in order to establish a maximum of eight million producers to forty-five million inhabitants
 Strictly speaking the creators of the goods exported from Britain to all the ends of the earth comprise only from six to seven million workers
 And what is the number of the shareholders and middlemen who levy the first fruits of labour from far and near, and heap up unearned gains by thrusting themselves between the producer and the consumer?  Nor is this all
 The owners of capital constantly reduce the output by restraining production
 We need not speak of the cartloads of oysters thrown into the sea to prevent a dainty, hitherto reserved for the rich, from becoming a food for the people
 We need not speak of the thousand and one luxuries--stuffs, foods, etc
, etc
--treated after the same fashion as the oysters
 It is enough to remember the way in which the production of the most necessary things is limited
 Legions of miners are ready and willing to dig out coal every day, and send it to those who are shivering with cold; but too often a third, or even one-half, of their number are forbidden to work more than three days a week, because, forsooth, the price of coal must be kept up! Thousands of weavers are forbidden to work the looms, although their wives and children go in rags, and although three-quarters of the population of Europe have no clothing worthy the name
  Hundreds of blast-furnaces, thousands of factories periodically stand idle, others only work half-time--and in every civilized nation there is a permanent population of about two million individuals who ask only for work, but to whom work is denied
  How gladly would these millions of men set to work to reclaim waste lands, or to transform ill-cultivated land into fertile fields, rich in harvests! A year of well-directed toil would suffice to multiply fivefold the produce of those millions of acres in this country which lie idle now as "permanent pasture," or of those dry lands in the south of France which now yield only about eight bushels of wheat per acre
 But men, who would be happy to become hardy pioneers in so many branches of wealth-producing activity, must remain idle because the owners of the soil, the mines and the factories prefer to invest their capital--taken in the first place from the community--in Turkish or Egyptian bonds, or in Patagonian gold mines, and so make Egyptian fellahs, Italian emigrants, and Chinese coolies their wage-slaves
  This is the direct and deliberate limitation of production; but there is also a limitation indirect and not of set purpose, which consists in spending human toil on objects absolutely useless, or destined only to satisfy the dull vanity of the rich
  It is impossible to reckon in figures the extent to which wealth is restricted indirectly, the extent to which energy is squandered, while it might have served to produce, and above all to prepare the machinery necessary to production
 It is enough to cite the immense sums spent by Europe in armaments, for the sole purpose of acquiring control of markets, and so forcing her own goods on neighbouring territories, and making exploitation easier at home; the millions paid every year to officials of all sorts, whose function it is to maintain the "rights" of minorities--the right, that is, of a few rich men--to manipulate the economic activities of the nation; the millions spent on judges, prisons, policemen, and all the paraphernalia of so-called justice--spent to no purpose, because we know that every alleviation, however slight, of the wretchedness of our great cities is always followed by a considerable diminution of crime; lastly, the millions spent on propagating pernicious doctrines by means of the press, and news "cooked" in the interest of this or that party, of this politician or of that group of speculators
  But over and above this we must take into account all the labour that goes to sheer waste,--here, in keeping up the stables, the kennels, and the retinue of the rich; there, in pandering to the caprices of society and the depraved tastes of the fashionable mob; there again, in forcing the consumer to buy what he does not need, or foisting an inferior article upon him by means of puffery, and in producing on the other hand wares which are absolutely injurious, but profitable to the manufacturer
 What is squandered in this manner would be enough to double the production of useful things, or so to plenish our mills and factories with machinery that they would soon flood the shops with all that is now lacking to two-thirds of the nation
 Under our present system a full quarter of the producers in every nation are forced to be idle for three or four months in the year, and the labour of another quarter, if not of the half, has no better results than the amusement of the rich or the exploitation of the public
  Thus, if we consider on the one hand the rapidity with which civilized nations augment their powers of production, and on the other hand the limits set to that production, be it directly or indirectly, by existing conditions, we cannot but conclude that an economic system a trifle more reasonable would permit them to heap up in a few years so many useful products that they would be constrained to say--"Enough! We have enough coal and bread and raiment! Let us rest and consider how best to use our powers, how best to employ our leisure
"  No, plenty for all is not a dream--though it was a dream indeed in those days when man, for all his pains, could hardly win a few bushels of wheat from an acre of land, and had to fashion by hand all the implements he used in agriculture and industry
 Now it is no longer a dream, because man has invented a motor which, with a little iron and a few sacks of coal, gives him the mastery of a creature strong and docile as a horse, and capable of setting the most complicated machinery in motion
  But, if plenty for all is to become a reality, this immense capital--cities, houses, pastures, arable lands, factories, highways, education--must cease to be regarded as private property, for the monopolist to dispose of at his pleasure
  This rich endowment, painfully won, builded, fashioned, or invented by our ancestors, must become common property, so that the collective interests of men may gain from it the greatest good for all
  There must be EXPROPRIATION
 The well-being of all--the end; expropriation--the means
   II  Expropriation, such then is the problem which History has put before the men of the twentieth century: the return to Communism in all that ministers to the well-being of man
  But this problem cannot be solved by means of legislation
 No one imagines that
 The poor, as well as the rich, understand that neither the existing Governments, nor any which might arise out of possible political changes, would be capable of finding such a solution
 They feel the necessity of a social revolution; and both rich and poor recognize that this revolution is imminent, that it may break out in a few years
  A great change in thought has taken place during the last half of the nineteenth century; but suppressed, as it was, by the propertied classes, and denied its natural development, this new spirit must now break its bonds by violence and realize itself in a revolution
  Whence will the revolution come? how will it announce its coming? No one can answer these questions
 The future is hidden
 But those who watch and think do not misinterpret the signs: workers and exploiters, Revolutionists and Conservatives, thinkers and men of action, all feel that a revolution is at our doors
  Well, then,--What are we going to do when the thunderbolt has fallen?  We have all been bent on studying the dramatic side of revolutions so much, and the practical work of revolutions so little, that we are apt to see only the stage effects, so to speak, of these great movements; the fight of the first days; the barricades
 But this fight, this first skirmish, is soon ended, and it only after the breakdown of the old system that the real work of revolution can be said to begin
  Effete and powerless, attacked on all sides, the old rulers are soon swept away by the breath of insurrection
 In a few days the middle-class monarchy of 1848 was no more, and while Louis Philippe was making good his escape in a cab, Paris had already forgotten her "citizen king
" The government of Thiers disappeared, on the 18th of March, 1871, in a few hours, leaving Paris mistress of her destinies
 Yet 1848 and 1871 were only insurrections
 Before a popular revolution the masters of "the old order" disappear with a surprising rapidity
 Its upholders fly the country, to plot in safety elsewhere and to devise measures for their return
  The former Government having disappeared, the army, hesitating before the tide of popular opinion, no longer obeys its commanders, who have also prudently decamped
 The troops stand by without interfering, or join the rebels
 The police, standing at ease, are uncertain whether to belabour the crowd, or to cry: "Long live the Commune!" while some retire to their quarters to "await the pleasure of the new Government
" Wealthy citizens pack their trunks and betake themselves to places of safety
 The people remain
 This is how a revolution is ushered in
  In several large towns the Commune is proclaimed
 In the streets wander scores of thousands of men, and in the evening they crowd into improvised clubs, asking: "What shall we do?" and ardently discuss public affairs
 All take an interest in them; those who yesterday were quite indifferent are perhaps the most zealous
 Everywhere there is plenty of good-will and a keen desire to make victory certain
 It is a time when acts of supreme devotion are occurring
 The masses of the people are full of the desire of going forward
  All this is splendid, sublime; but still, it is not a revolution
 Nay, it is only now that the work of the revolutionist begins
  Doubtless there will be acts of vengeance
 The Watrins and the Thomases will pay the penalty of their unpopularity; but these are mere incidents of the struggle--not the revolution
  Socialist politicians, radicals, neglected geniuses of journalism, stump orators--both middle-class people and workmen--will hurry to the Town Hall, to the Government offices, to take possession of the vacant seats
 Some will decorate themselves with gold and silver lace to their hearts' content, admire themselves in ministerial mirrors, and study to give orders with an air of importance appropriate to their new position
 How could they impress their comrades of the office or the workshop without having a red sash, an embroidered cap, and magisterial gestures! Others will bury themselves in official papers, trying, with the best of wills, to make head or tail of them
 They will indite laws and issue high-flown worded decrees that nobody will take the trouble to carry out--because revolution has come
  To give themselves an authority which they have not they will seek the sanction of old forms of Government
 They will take the names of "Provisional Government," "Committee of Public Safety," "Mayor," "Governor of the Town Hall," "Commissioner of Public Safety," and what not
 Elected or acclaimed, they will assemble in Boards or in Communal Councils, where men of ten or twenty different schools will come together, representing--not as many "private chapels," as it is often said, but as many different conceptions regarding the scope, the bearing, and the goal of the revolution
 Possibilists, Collectivists, Radicals, Jacobins, Blanquists, will be thrust together, and waste time in wordy warfare
 Honest men will be huddled together with the ambitious ones, whose only dream is power and who spurn the crowd whence they are sprung
 All coming together with diametrically opposed views, all--forced to enter into ephemeral alliances, in order to create majorities that can but last a day
 Wrangling, calling each other reactionaries, authoritarians, and rascals, incapable of coming to an understanding on any serious measure, dragged into discussions about trifles, producing nothing better than bombastic proclamations; all giving themselves an awful importance while the real strength of the movement is in the streets
  All this may please those who like the stage, but it is not revolution
 Nothing has been accomplished as yet
  And meanwhile the people suffer
 The factories are idle, the workshops closed; trade is at a standstill
 The worker does not even earn the meagre wage which was his before
 Food goes up in price
 With that heroic devotion which has always characterized them, and which in great crises reaches the sublime, the people will wait patiently
 "We place these three months of want at the service of the Republic," they said in 1848, while "their representatives" and the gentlemen of the new Government, down to the meanest Jack-in-office received their salary regularly
  The people suffer
 With the childlike faith, with the good humour of the masses who believe in their leaders, they think that "yonder," in the House, in the Town Hall, in the Committee of Public Safety, their welfare is being considered
 But "yonder" they are discussing everything under the sun except the welfare of the people
 In 1793, while famine ravaged France and crippled the Revolution; whilst the people were reduced to the depths of misery, although the Champs Elysées were lined with luxurious carriages where women displayed their jewels and splendour, Robespierre was urging the Jacobins to discuss his treatise on the English Constitution
 While the worker was suffering in 1848 from the general stoppage of trade, the Provisional Government and the National Assembly were wrangling over military pensions and prison labour, without troubling how the people managed to live during the terrible crisis
 And could one cast a reproach at the Paris Commune, which was born beneath the Prussian cannon, and lasted only seventy days, it would be for this same error--this failure to understand that the Revolution could not triumph unless those who fought on its side were fed: that on fifteen pence a day a man cannot fight on the ramparts and at the same time support a family
  The people will suffer and say: "How is a way out of these difficulties to be found?"   III  It seems to us that there is only one answer to this question: We must recognize, and loudly proclaim, that every one, whatever his grade in the old society, whether strong or weak, capable or incapable, has, before everything, THE RIGHT TO LIVE, and that society is bound to share amongst all, without exception, the means of existence it has at its disposal
 We must acknowledge this, and proclaim it aloud, and act up to it
  Affairs must be managed in such a way that from the first day of the revolution the worker shall know that a new era is opening before him; that henceforward none need crouch under the bridges, while palaces are hard by, none need fast in the midst of plenty, none need perish with cold near shops full of furs; that all is for all, in practice as well as in theory, and that at last, for the first time in history, a revolution has been accomplished which considers the NEEDS of the people before schooling them in their DUTIES
  This cannot be brought about by Acts of Parliament, but only by taking immediate and effective possession of all that is necessary to ensure the well-being of all; this is the only really scientific way of going to work, the only way which can be understood and desired by the mass of the people
 We must take possession, in the name of the people, of the granaries, the shops full of clothing and the dwelling houses
 Nothing must be wasted
 We must organize without delay a way to feed the hungry, to satisfy all wants, to meet all needs, to produce not for the special benefit of this one or that one, but so as to ensure to society as a whole its life and further development
  Enough of ambiguous words like "the right to work," with which the people were misled in 1848, and which are still resorted to with the hope of misleading them
 Let us have the courage to recognise that _Well-being for all_, henceforward possible, must be realized
  When the workers claimed the right to work in 1848, national and municipal workshops were organized, and workmen were sent to drudge there at the rate of 1s
 8d
 a day! When they asked the "Organization of Labour," the reply was: "Patience, friends, the Government will see to it; meantime here is your 1s
 8d
 Rest now, brave toiler, after your life-long struggle for food!" And in the meantime the cannons were overhauled, the reserves called out, and the workers themselves disorganized by the many methods well known to the middle classes, till one fine day, in June, 1848, four months after the overthrow of the previous Government, they were told to go and colonize Africa, or be shot down
  Very different will be the result if the workers claim the RIGHT TO WELL-BEING! In claiming that right they claim the right to take possession of the wealth of the community--to take houses to dwell in according to the needs of each family; to socialize the stores of food and learn the meaning of plenty, after having known famine too well
 They proclaim their right to all social wealth--fruit of the labour of past and present generations--and learn by its means to enjoy those higher pleasures of art and science which have too long been monopolized by the rich
  And while asserting their right to live in comfort, they assert, what is still more important, their right to decide for themselves what this comfort shall be, what must be produced to ensure it, and what discarded as no longer of value
  The "right to well-being" means the possibility of living like human beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a society better than ours, whilst the "right to work" only means the right to be always a wage-slave, a drudge, ruled over and exploited by the middle class of the future
 The right to well-being is the Social Revolution, the right to work means nothing but the Treadmill of Commercialism
 It is high time for the worker to assert his right to the common inheritance, and to enter into possession of it
  FOOTNOTE:  [1] 4,013,711 now employed in all the 53 branches of different industries, including the State Ordnance Works, and 241,530 workers engaged in the Construction and Maintenance of Railways, their aggregate production reaching the value of £1,041,037,000, and the net output being £406,799,000
     CHAPTER III  ANARCHIST COMMUNISM   I  Every society, on abolishing private property will be forced, we maintain, to organize itself on the lines of Communistic Anarchy
 Anarchy leads to Communism, and Communism to Anarchy, both alike being expressions of the predominant tendency in modern societies, the pursuit of equality
  Time was when a peasant family could consider the corn it sowed and reaped, or the woolen garments woven in the cottage, as the products of its own soil
 But even then this way of looking at things was not quite correct
 There were the roads and the bridges made in common, the swamps drained by common toil, the communal pastures enclosed by hedges which were kept in repair by each and all
 If the looms for weaving or the dyes for colouring fabrics were improved by somebody, all profited; and even in those days a peasant family could not live alone, but was dependent in a thousand ways on the village or the commune
  But nowadays, in the present state of industry, when everything is interdependent, when each branch of production is knit up with all the rest, the attempt to claim an Individualist origin for the products of industry is absolutely untenable
 The astonishing perfection attained by the textile or mining industries in civilized countries is due to the simultaneous development of a thousand other industries, great and small, to the extension of the railroad system, to inter-oceanic navigation, to the manual skill of thousands of workers, to a certain standard of culture reached by the working class as a whole--to the labours, in short, of men in every corner of the globe
  The Italians who died of cholera while making the Suez Canal, or of anchylosis in the St
 Gothard Tunnel, and the Americans mowed down by shot and shell while fighting for the abolition of slavery, have helped to develop the cotton industry of France and England, as well as the work-girls who languish in the factories of Manchester and Rouen, and the inventor who (following the suggestion of some worker) succeeds in improving the looms
  How then, shall we estimate the share of each in the riches which ALL contribute to amass?  Looking at production from this general, synthetic point of view, we cannot hold with the Collectivists that payment proportionate to the hours of labour rendered by each would be an ideal arrangement, or even a step in the right direction
  Without discussing whether exchange value of goods is really measured in existing societies by the amount of work necessary to produce it--according to the teaching of Adam Smith and Ricardo, in whose footsteps Marx has followed--suffice it to say here, leaving ourselves free to return to the subject later, that the Collectivist ideal appears to us untenable in a society which considers the instruments of labour as a common inheritance
 Starting from this principle, such a society would find itself forced from the very outset to abandon all forms of wages
  The migrated individualism of the Collectivist system certainly could not maintain itself alongside a partial communism--the socialization of land and the instruments of production
 A new form of property requires a new form of remuneration
 A new method of production cannot exist side by side with the old forms of consumption, any more than it can adapt itself to the old forms of political organization
  The wage system arises out of the individual ownership of the land and the instruments of labour
 It was the necessary condition for the development of capitalist production, and will perish with it, in spite of the attempt to disguise it as "profit-sharing
" The common possession of the instruments of labour must necessarily bring with it the enjoyment in common of the fruits of common labour
  We hold further that Communism is not only desirable, but that existing societies, founded on Individualism, _are inevitably impelled in the direction of Communism_
 The development of Individualism during the last three centuries is explained by the efforts of the individual to protect himself from the tyranny of Capital and of the State
 For a time he imagined, and those who expressed his thought for him declared, that he could free himself entirely from the State and from society
 "By means of money," he said, "I can buy all that I need
" But the individual was on a wrong track, and modern history has taught him to recognize that, without the help of all, he can do nothing, although his strong-boxes are full of gold
  In fact, along this current of Individualism, we find in all modern history a tendency, on the one hand to retain all that remains of the partial Communism of antiquity, and, on the other, to establish the Communist principle in the thousand developments of modern life
  As soon as the communes of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries had succeeded in emancipating themselves from their lords, ecclesiastical or lay, their communal labour and communal consumption began to extend and develop rapidly
 The township--and not private persons--freighted ships and equipped expeditions, for the export of their manufacture, and the benefit arising from the foreign trade did not accrue to individuals, but was shared by all
 At the outset, the townships also bought provisions for all their citizens
 Traces of these institutions have lingered on into the nineteenth century, and the people piously cherish the memory of them in their legends
  All that has disappeared
 But the rural township still struggles to preserve the last traces of this Communism, and it succeeds--except when the State throws its heavy sword into the balance
  Meanwhile new organizations, based on the same principle--_to every man according to his needs_--spring up under a thousand different forms; for without a certain leaven of Communism the present societies could not exist
 In spite of the narrowly egoistic turn given to men's minds by the commercial system, the tendency towards Communism is constantly appearing, and it influences our activities in a variety of ways
  The bridges, for the use of which a toll was levied in the old days, have become public property and are free to all; so are the high roads, except in the East, where a toll is still exacted from the traveller for every mile of his journey
 Museums, free libraries, free schools, free meals for children; parks and gardens open to all; streets paved and lighted, free to all; water supplied to every house without measure or stint--all such arrangements are founded on the principle: "Take what you need
"  The tramways and railways have already introduced monthly and annual season tickets, without limiting the number of journeys taken; and two nations, Hungary and Russia, have introduced on their railways the zone system, which permits the holder to travel five hundred or eight hundred miles for the same price
 It is but a short step from that to a uniform charge, such as already prevails in the postal service
 In all these innovations, and in a thousand others, the tendency is not to measure the individual consumption
 One man wants to travel eight hundred miles, another five hundred
 These are personal requirements
 There is no sufficient reason why one should pay twice as much as the other because his need is twice as great
 Such are the signs which appear even now in our individualist societies
  Moreover, there is a tendency, though still a feeble one, to consider the needs of the individual, irrespective of his past or possible services to the community
 We are beginning to think of society as a whole, each part of which is so intimately bound up with the others that a service rendered to one is a service rendered to all
  When you go to a public library--not indeed the National Library of Paris, but, say, into the British Museum or the Berlin Library--the librarian does not ask what services you have rendered to society before giving you the book, or the fifty books, which you require; he even comes to your assistance if you do not know how to manage the catalogue
 By means of uniform credentials--and very often a contribution of work is preferred--the scientific society opens its museums, its gardens, its library, its laboratories, and its annual conversaziones to each of its members, whether he be a Darwin, or a simple amateur
  At St
 Petersburg, if you are elaborating an invention, you go into a special laboratory, where you are given a place, a carpenter's bench, a turning lathe, all the necessary tools and scientific instruments, provided only you know how to use them; and you are allowed to work there as long as you please
 There are the tools; interest others in your idea; join with fellow workers skilled in various crafts, or work alone if you prefer it
 Invent a flying machine, or invent nothing--that is your own affair
 You are pursuing an idea--that is enough
  In the same way, those who man the lifeboat do not ask credentials from the crew of a sinking ship; they launch their boat, risk their lives in the raging waves, and sometimes perish, all to save men whom they do not even know
 And what need to know them? "They are human beings, and they need our aid--that is enough, that establishes their right---- To the rescue!"  Thus we find a tendency, eminently communistic, springing up on all sides, and in various guises, in the very heart of theoretically individualist societies
  Suppose that one of our great cities, so egotistic in ordinary times, were visited to-morrow by some calamity--a siege, for instance--that same selfish city would decide that the first needs to satisfy were those of the children and the aged
 Without asking what services they had rendered, or were likely to render to society, it would first of all feed them
 Then the combatants would be cared for, irrespective of the courage or the intelligence which each had displayed, and thousands of men and women would outvie each other in unselfish devotion to the wounded
  This tendency exists, and is felt as soon as the most pressing needs of each are satisfied, and in proportion as the productive power of the race increases
 It becomes an active force every time a great idea comes to oust the mean preoccupations of everyday life
  How can we doubt, then, that when the instruments of production are placed at the service of all, when business is conducted on Communist principles, when labour, having recovered its place of honour in society, produces much more than is necessary to all--how can we doubt that this force (already so powerful), will enlarge its sphere of action till it becomes the ruling principle of social life?  Following these indications, and considering further the practical side of expropriation, of which we shall speak in the following chapters, we are convinced that our first obligation, when the revolution shall have broken the power upholding the present system, will be to realize Communism without delay
  But ours is neither the Communism of Fourier and the Phalansteriens, nor of the German State Socialists
 It is Anarchist Communism, Communism without government--the Communism of the Free
 It is the synthesis of the two ideals pursued by humanity throughout the ages--Economic and Political Liberty
   II  In taking "Anarchy" for our ideal of political organization we are only giving expression to another marked tendency of human progress
 Whenever European societies have developed up to a certain point, they have shaken off the yoke of authority and substituted a system founded more or less on the principles of individual liberty
 And history shows us that these periods of partial or general revolution, when the old governments were overthrown, were also periods of sudden, progress both in the economic and the intellectual field
 So it was after the enfranchisement of the communes, whose monuments, produced by the free labour of the guilds, have never been surpassed; so it was after the great peasant uprising which brought about the Reformation and imperilled the papacy; and so it was again with the society, free for a brief space, which was created on the other side of the Atlantic by the malcontents from the Old world
  And, if we observe the present development of civilized nations, we see, most unmistakably, a movement ever more and more marked tending to limit the sphere of action of the Government, and to allow more and more liberty to the individual
 This evolution is going on before our eyes, though cumbered by the ruins and rubbish of old institutions and old superstitions
 Like all evolutions, it only waits a revolution to overthrow the old obstacles which block the way, that it may find free scope in a regenerated society
  After having striven long in vain to solve the insoluble problem--the problem of constructing a government "which will constrain the individual to obedience without itself ceasing to be the servant of society," men at last attempt to free themselves from every form of government and to satisfy their need for organization by free contacts between individuals and groups pursuing the same aim
 The independence of each small territorial unit becomes a pressing need; mutual agreement replaces law in order to regulate individual interests in view of a common object--very often disregarding the frontiers of the present States
  All that was once looked on as a function of the Government is to-day called in question
 Things are arranged more easily and more satisfactorily without the intervention of the State
 And in studying the progress made in this direction, we are led to conclude that the tendency of the human race is to reduce Government interference to zero; in fact, to abolish the State, the personification of injustice, oppression, and monopoly
  We can already catch glimpses of a world in which the bonds which bind the individual are no longer laws, but social habits--the result of the need felt by each one of us to seek the support, the co-operation, the sympathy of his neighbours
  Assuredly the idea of a society without a State will give rise to at least as many objections as the political economy of a society without private capital
 We have all been brought up from our childhood to regard the State as a sort of Providence; all our education, the Roman history we learned at school, the Byzantine code which we studied later under the name of Roman law, and the various sciences taught at the universities, accustom us to believe in Government and in the virtues of the State providential
  To maintain this superstition whole systems of philosophy have been elaborated and taught; all politics are based on this principle; and each politician, whatever his colours, comes forward and says to the people, "Give my party the power; we can and we will free you from the miseries which press so heavily upon you
"  From the cradle to the grave all our actions are guided by this principle
 Open any book on sociology or jurisprudence, and you will find there the Government, its organization, its acts, filling so large a place that we come to believe that there is nothing outside the Government and the world of statesmen
  The Press teaches us the same in every conceivable way
 Whole columns are devoted to parliamentary debates and to political intrigues; while the vast everyday life of a nation appears only in the columns given to economic subjects, or in the pages devoted to reports of police and law cases
 And when you read the newspapers, your hardly think of the incalculable number of beings--all humanity, so to say--who grow up and die, who know sorrow, who work and consume, think and create outside the few encumbering personages who have been so magnified that humanity is hidden by their shadows, enlarged by our ignorance
  And yet as soon as we pass from printed matter to life itself, as soon as we throw a glance at society, we are struck by the infinitesimal part played by the Government
 Balzac already has remarked how millions of peasants spend the whole of their lives without knowing anything about the State, save the heavy taxes they are compelled to pay
 Every day millions of transactions are made without Government intervention, and the greatest of them--those of commerce and of the Exchange--are carried on in such a way that the Government could not be appealed to if one of the contracting parties had the intention of not fulfilling his agreement
 Should you speak to a man who understands commerce, he will tell you that the everyday business transacted by merchants would be absolutely impossible were it not based on mutual confidence
 The habit of keeping his word, the desire not to lose his credit, amply suffice to maintain this relative honesty
 The man who does not feel the slightest remorse when poisoning his customers with noxious drugs covered with pompous labels, thinks he is in honour bound to keep his engagements
 But if this relative morality has developed under present conditions, when enrichment is the only incentive and the only aim, can we doubt its rapid progress when appropriation of the fruits of others' labour will no longer be the basis of society?  Another striking fact, which especially characterizes our generation, speaks still more in favour of our ideas
 It is the continual extension of the field of enterprise due to private initiative, and the prodigious development of free organizations of all kinds
 We shall discuss this more at length in the chapter devoted to _Free Agreement_
 Suffice it to mention that the facts are so numerous and so customary that they are the essence of the second half of the nineteenth century, even though political and socialist writers ignore them, always preferring to talk to us about the functions of the Government
  These organizations, free and infinitely varied, are so natural an outcome of our civilization; they expand so rapidly and federate with so much ease; they are so necessary a result of the continual growth of the needs of civilized man; and lastly, they so advantageously replace governmental interference, that we must recognize in them a factor of growing importance in the life of societies
 If they do not yet spread over the whole of the manifestations of life, it is that they find an insurmountable obstacle in the poverty of the worker, in the divisions of present society, in the private appropriation of capital, and in the State
 Abolish these obstacles, and you will see them covering the immense field of civilized man's activity
  The history of the last fifty years furnishes a living proof that Representative Government is impotent to discharge all the functions we have sought to assign to it
 In days to come the nineteenth century will be quoted as having witnessed the failure of parliamentarianism
  This impotence is becoming so evident to all; the faults of parliamentarianism, and the inherent vices of the representative principle, are so self-evident, that the few thinkers who have made a critical study of them (J
 S
 Mill, Leverdays), did but give literary form to the popular dissatisfaction
 It is not difficult, indeed, to see the absurdity of naming a few men and saying to them, "Make laws regulating all our spheres of activity, although not one of you knows anything about them!"  We are beginning to see that government by majorities means abandoning all the affairs of the country to the tide-waiters who make up the majorities in the House and in election committees; to those, in a word, who have no opinion of their own
  Mankind is seeking and already finding new issues
 The International Postal Union, the railway unions, and the learned societies give us examples of solutions based on free agreement in place and stead of law
  To-day, when groups scattered far and wide wish to organize themselves for some object or other, they no longer elect an international parliament of Jacks-of-all-trades
 They proceed in a different way
 Where it is not possible to meet directly or come to an agreement by correspondence, delegates versed in the question at issue are sent, and they are told: "Endeavour to come to an agreement on such or such a question, and then return, not with a law in your pocket, but with a proposition of agreement which we may or may not accept
"  Such is the method of the great industrial companies, the learned societies, and numerous associations of every description, which already cover Europe and the United States
 And such will be the method of a free society
 A society founded on serfdom is in keeping with absolute monarchy; a society based on the wage system and the exploitation of the masses by the capitalists finds its political expression in parliamentarianism
 But a free society, regaining possession of the common inheritance, must seek in free groups and free federations of groups, a new organization, in harmony with the new economic phase of history
  Every economic phase has a political phase corresponding to it, and it would be impossible to touch private property unless a new mode of political life be found at the same time
     CHAPTER IV  EXPROPRIATION   I  It is told of Rothschild that, seeing his fortune threatened by the Revolution of 1848, he hit upon the following stratagem: "I am quite willing to admit," said he, "that my fortune has been accumulated at the expense of others; but if it were divided to-morrow among the millions of Europe, the share of each would only amount to four shillings
 Very well, then, I undertake to render to each his four shillings if he asks me for it
"  Having given due publicity to his promise, our millionaire proceeded as usual to stroll quietly through the streets of Frankfort
 Three or four passers-by asked for their four shillings, which he disbursed with a sardonic smile
 His stratagem succeeded, and the family of the millionaire is still in possession of its wealth
  It is in much the same fashion that the shrewed heads among the middle classes reason when they say, "Ah, Expropriation! I know what that means
 You take all the overcoats and lay them in a heap, and every one is free to help himself and fight for the best
"  But such jests are irrelevant as well as flippant
 What we want is not a redistribution of overcoats, although it must be said that even in such a case, the shivering folk would see advantage in it
 Nor do we want to divide up the wealth of the Rothschilds
 What we do want is so to arrange things that every human being born into the world shall be ensured the opportunity, in the first instance of learning some useful occupation, and of becoming skilled in it; and next, that he shall be free to work at his trade without asking leave of master or owner, and without handing over to landlord or capitalist the lion's share of what he produces
 As to the wealth held by the Rothschilds or the Vanderbilts, it will serve us to organize our system of communal production
  The day when the labourer may till the ground without paying away half of what he produces, the day when the machines necessary to prepare the soil for rich harvests are at the free disposal of the cultivators, the day when the worker in the factory produces for the community and not the monopolist--that day will see the workers clothed and fed, and there will be no more Rothschilds or other exploiters
  No one will then have to sell his working power for a wage that only represents a fraction of what he produces
  "So far, so good," say our critics, "but you will have Rothschilds coming in from the outside
 How are you to prevent a person from amassing millions in China, and then settling amongst you? How are you going to prevent such a one from surrounding himself with lackeys and wage-slaves--from exploiting them and enriching himself at their expense?  "You cannot bring about a revolution all over the world at the same time
 Well, then--are you going to establish custom-houses on your frontiers to search all who enter your country and confiscate the money they bring with them?--Anarchist policemen firing on travellers would be a fine spectacle!"  But at the root of this argument there is a great error
 Those who propound it have never paused to inquire whence come the fortunes of the rich
 A little thought would, however, suffice to show them that these fortunes have their beginnings in the poverty of the poor
 When there are no longer any destitute, there will no longer be any rich to exploit them
  Let us glance for a moment at the Middle Ages, when great fortunes began to spring up
  A feudal baron seizes on a fertile valley
 But as long as the fertile valley is empty of folk our baron is not rich
 His land brings him in nothing; he might as well possess a property in the moon
  What does our baron do to enrich himself? He looks out for peasants--for poor peasants!  If every peasant-farmer had a piece of land, free from rent and taxes, if he had in addition the tools and the stock necessary for farm labour--Who would plough the lands of the baron? Everyone would look after his own
 But there are thousands of destitute persons ruined by wars, or drought, or pestilence
 They have neither horse nor plough
 (Iron was very costly in the Middle Ages, and a draught-horse still more so
)  All these destitute creatures are trying to better their condition
 One day they see on the road at the confines of our baron's estate a notice-board indicating by certain signs adapted to their comprehension that the labourer who is willing to settle on his estate will receive the tools and materials to build his cottage and sow his fields, and a portion of land rent free for a certain number of years
 The number of years is represented by so many crosses on the sign-board, and the peasant understands the meaning of these crosses
  So the poor wretches come to settle on the baron's lands
 They make roads, drain the marshes, build villages
 In nine or ten years the baron begins to tax them
 Five years later he increases the rent
 Then he doubles it, and the peasant accepts these new conditions because he cannot find better ones elsewhere
 Little by little, with the aid of laws made by the barons, the poverty of the peasant becomes the source of the landlord's wealth
 And it is not only the lord of the manor who preys upon him
 A whole host of usurers swoop down upon the villages, multiplying as the wretchedness of the peasants increases
 That is how these things happened in the Middle Ages
 And to-day is it not still the same thing? If there were free lands which the peasant could cultivate if he pleased, would he pay £50 to some "shabble of a Duke"[2] for condescending to sell him a scrap? Would he burden himself with a lease which absorbed a third of the produce? Would he--on the _métayer_ system--consent to give half of his harvest to the landowner?  But he has nothing
 So he will accept any conditions, if only he can keep body and soul together, while he tills the soil and enriches the landlord
  So in the nineteenth century, just as in the Middle Ages, the poverty of the peasant is a source of wealth to the landed proprietor
   II  The landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source
  Take the case of a citizen of the middle class, who somehow or other finds himself in possession of £20,000
 He could, of course, spend his money at the rate of £2,000 a year, a mere bagatelle in these days of fantastic, senseless luxury
 But then he would have nothing left at the end of ten years
 So, being a "practical person," he prefers to keep his fortune intact, and win for himself a snug little annual income as well
  This is very easy in our society, for the good reason that the towns and villages swarm with workers who have not the wherewithal to live for a month, or even a fortnight
 So our worthy citizen starts a factory
 The banks hasten to lend him another £20,000, especially if he has a reputation for "business ability"; and with this round sum he can command the labour of five hundred hands
  If all the men and women in the countryside had their daily bread assured, and their daily needs already satisfied, who would work for our capitalist at a wage of half a crown a day, while the commodities one produces in a day sell in the market for a crown or more?  Unhappily--we know it all too well--the poor quarters of our towns and the neighbouring villages are full of needy wretches, whose children clamour for bread
 So, before the factory is well finished, the workers hasten to offer themselves
 Where a hundred are required three hundred besiege the doors, and from the time his mill is started, the owner, if he only has average business capacities, will clear £40 a year out of each mill-hand he employs
  He is thus able to lay by a snug little fortune; and if he chooses a lucrative trade, and has "business talents," he will soon increase his income by doubling the number of men he exploits
  So he becomes a personage of importance
 He can afford to give dinners to other personages--to the local magnates, the civic, legal, and political dignitaries
 With his money he can "marry money"; by and by he may pick and choose places for his children, and later on perhaps get something good from the Government--a contract for the army or for the police
 His gold breeds gold; till at last a war, or even a rumour of war, or a speculation on the Stock Exchange, gives him his great opportunity
  Nine-tenths of the great fortunes made in the United States are (as Henry George has shown in his "Social Problems") the result of knavery on a large scale, assisted by the State
 In Europe, nine-tenths of the fortunes made in our monarchies and republics have the same origin
 There are not two ways of becoming a millionaire
  This is the secret of wealth: find the starving and destitute, pay them half a crown, and make them produce five shillings worth in the day, amass a fortune by these means, and then increase it by some lucky speculation, made with the help of the State
  Need we go on to speak of small fortunes attributed by the economists to forethought and frugality, when we know that mere saving in itself brings in nothing, so long as the pence saved are not used to exploit the famishing?  Take a shoemaker, for instance
 Grant that his work is well paid, that he has plenty of custom, and that by dint of strict frugality he contrives to lay by from eighteen pence to two shillings a day, perhaps two pounds a month
  Grant that our shoemaker is never ill, that he does not half starve himself, in spite of his passion for economy; that he does not marry or that he has no children; that he does not die of consumption; suppose anything and everything you please!  Well, at the age of fifty he will not have scraped together £800; and he will not have enough to live on during his old age, when he is past work
 Assuredly this is not how fortunes are made
 But suppose our shoemaker, as soon as he has laid by a few pence, thriftily conveys them to the savings bank and that the savings bank lends them to the capitalist who is just about to "employ labour," i
e
, to exploit the poor
 Then our shoemaker takes an apprentice, the child of some poor wretch, who will think himself lucky if in five years' time his son has learned the trade and is able to earn his living
  Meanwhile our shoemaker does not lose by him, and if trade is brisk he soon takes a second, and then a third apprentice
 By and by he will take two or three working men--poor wretches, thankful to receive half a crown a day for work that is worth five shillings, and if our shoemaker is "in luck," that is to say, if he is keen enough and mean enough, his working men and apprentices will bring him in nearly one pound a day, over and above the product of his own toil
 He can then enlarge his business
 He will gradually become rich, and no longer have any need to stint himself in the necessaries of life
 He will leave a snug little fortune to his son
  That is what people call "being economical and having frugal, temperate habits
" At bottom it is nothing more nor less than grinding the face of the poor
  Commerce seems an exception to this rule
 "Such a man," we are told, "buys tea in China, brings it to France, and realizes a profit of thirty per cent
 on his original outlay
 He has exploited nobody
"  Nevertheless the case is quite similar
 If our merchant had carried his bales on his back, well and good! In early medieval times that was exactly how foreign trade was conducted, and so no one reached such giddy heights of fortune as in our days
 Very few and very hardly earned were the gold coins which the medieval merchant gained from a long and dangerous voyage
 It was less the love of money than the thirst of travel and adventure that inspired his undertakings
  Nowadays the method is simpler
 A merchant who has some capital need not stir from his desk to become wealthy
 He telegraphs to an agent telling him to buy a hundred tons of tea; he freights a ship, and in a few weeks, in three months if it is a sailing ship, the vessels brings him his cargo
 He does not even take the risks of the voyage, for his tea and his vessel are insured, and if he has expended four thousand pounds he will receive more than five or six thousand; that is to say, if he has not attempted to speculate in some novel commodities, in which case he runs a chance of either doubling his fortune or losing it altogether
  Now, how could he find men willing to cross the sea, to travel to China and back, to endure hardship and slavish toil and to risk their lives for a miserable pittance? How could he find dock labourers willing to load and unload his ships for "starvation wages"? How? Because they are needy and starving
 Go to the seaports, visit the cook-shops and taverns on the quays, and look at these men who have come to hire themselves, crowding round the dock-gates, which they besiege from early dawn, hoping to be allowed to work on the vessels
 Look at these sailors, happy to be hired for a long voyage, after weeks and months of waiting
 All their lives long they have gone to the sea in ships, and they will sail in others still, until they have perished in the waves
  Enter their homes, look at their wives and children in rags, living one knows not how till the father's return, and you will have the answer to the question
  Multiply examples, choose them where you will, consider the origin of all fortunes, large or small, whether arising out of commerce, finance, manufacturers, or the land
 Everywhere you will find that the wealth of the wealthy springs from the poverty of the poor
 This is why an anarchist society need not fear the advent of a Rothschild who would settle in its midst
 If every member of the community knows that after a few hours of productive toil he will have a right to all the pleasures that civilization procures, and to those deeper sources of enjoyment which art and science offer to all who seek them, he will not sell his strength for a starvation wage
 No one will volunteer to work for the enrichment of your Rothschild
 His golden guineas will be only so many pieces of metal--useful for various purposes, but incapable of breeding more
  In answering the above objection we have at the same time indicated the scope of Expropriation
 It must apply to everything that enables any man--be he financier, mill-owner, or landlord--to appropriate the product of others' toil
 Our formula is simple and comprehensive
  We do not want to rob any one of his coat, but we wish to give to the workers all those things the lack of which makes them fall an easy prey to the exploiter, and we will do our utmost that none shall lack aught, that not a single man shall be forced to sell the strength of his right arm to obtain a bare subsistence for himself and his babes
 This is what we mean when we talk of Expropriation; this will be our duty during the Revolution, for whose coming we look, not two hundred years hence, but soon, very soon
   III  The ideas of Anarchism in general and of Expropriation in particular find much more sympathy than we are apt to imagine among men of independent character, and those for whom idleness is not the supreme ideal
 "Still," our friends often warn us, "take care you do not go too far! Humanity cannot be changed in a day, so do not be in to great a hurry with your schemes of Expropriation and Anarchy, or you will be in danger of achieving no permanent result
"  Now, what we fear with regard to Expropriation is exactly the contrary
 We are afraid of not going far enough, of carrying out Expropriation on too small a scale to be lasting
 We would not have the revolutionary impulse arrested in mid-career, to exhaust itself in half measures, which would content no one, and while producing a tremendous confusion in society, and stopping its customary activities, would have no vital power--would merely spread general discontent and inevitably prepare the way for the triumph of reaction
  There are, in fact, in a modern State established relations which it is practically impossible to modify if one attacks them only in detail
 There are wheels within wheels in our economic organization--the machinery is so complex and interdependent that no one part can be modified without disturbing the whole
 This becomes clear as soon as an attempt is made to expropriate anything
  Let us suppose that in a certain country a limited form of expropriation is effected
 For example, that, as it has been suggested more than once, only the property of the great landlords is socialized, whilst the factories are left untouched; or that, in a certain city, house property is taken over by the Commune, but everything else is left to private ownership; or that, in some manufacturing centre, the factories are communalized, but the land is not interfered with
  The same result would follow in each case--a terrible shattering of the industrial system, without the means of reorganizing it on new lines
 Industry and finance would be at a deadlock, yet a return to the first principles of justice would not have been achieved, and society would find itself powerless to construct a harmonious whole
  If agriculture were freed from great landowners, while industry still remained the bond-slave of the capitalist, the merchant, and the banker, nothing would be accomplished
 The peasant suffers to-day not only in having to pay rent to the landlord; he is oppressed on all hands by existing conditions
 He is exploited by the tradesman, who makes him pay half a crown for a spade which, measured by the labour spent on it, is not worth more than sixpence
 He is taxed by the State, which cannot do without its formidable hierarchy of officials, and finds it necessary to maintain an expensive army, because the traders of all nations are perpetually fighting for the markets, and any day a little quarrel arising from the exploitation of some part of Asia or Africa may result in war
  Then again the peasant suffers from the depopulation of country places: the young people are attracted to the large manufacturing towns by the bait of high wages paid temporarily by the producers of articles of luxury, or by the attractions of a more stirring life
 The artificial protection of industry, the industrial exploitation of foreign countries, the prevalence of stock-jobbing, the difficulty of improving the soil and the machinery of production--all these agencies combine nowadays to work against agriculture, which is burdened not only by rent, but by the whole complex of conditions in a society based on exploitation
 Thus, even if the expropriation of land were accomplished, and every one were free to till the soil and cultivate it to the best advantage, without paying rent, agriculture, even though it should enjoy--which can by no means be taken for granted--a momentary prosperity, would soon fall back into the slough in which it finds itself to-day
 The whole thing would have to be begun over again, with increased difficulties
  The same holds true of industry
 Take the converse case: instead of turning the agricultural labourers into peasant-proprietors, make over the factories to those who work in them
 Abolish the master-manufacturers, but leave the landlord his land, the banker his money, the merchant his Exchange; maintain the swarm of idlers who live on the toil of the workmen, the thousand and one middlemen, the State with its numberless officials,--and industry would come to a standstill
 Finding no purchasers in the mass of peasants who would remain poor; not possessing the raw material, and unable to export their produce, partly on account of the stoppage of trade, and still more so because industries spread all over the world, the manufacturers would feel unable to struggle, and thousands of workers would be thrown upon the streets
 These starving crowds would be ready and willing to submit to the first schemer who came to exploit them; they would even consent to return to the old slavery, under promise of guaranteed work
  Or, finally, suppose you oust the landowners, and hand over the mills and factories to the worker, without interfering with the swarm of middlemen who drain the product of our manufacturers, and speculate in corn and flour, meat and groceries, in our great centres of commerce
 Then, as soon as the exchange of produce is slackened; as soon as the great cities are left without bread, while the great manufacturing centres find no buyers for the articles of luxury they produce,--the counter-revolution is bound to take place, and it would come, treading upon the slain, sweeping the towns and villages with shot and shell; indulging in orgies of proscriptions and deportations, such as were seen in France in 1815, 1848, and 1871
  All is interdependent in a civilized society; it is impossible to reform any one thing without altering the whole
 Therefore, on the day a nation will strike at private property, under any one of its forms, territorial or industrial, it will be obliged to attack them all
 The very success of the Revolution will impose it
  Besides, even if it were desired, it would be impossible to confine the change to a partial expropriation
 Once the principle of the "Divine Right of Property" is shaken, no amount of theorizing will prevent its overthrow, here by the slaves of the field, there by the slaves of the machine
  If a great town, Paris for example, were to confine itself to taking possession of the dwelling houses of the factories, it would be forced also to deny the right of the bankers to levy upon the Commune a tax amounting to £2,000,000, in the form of interest for former loans
 The great city would be obliged to put itself in touch with the rural districts, and its influence would inevitably urge the peasants to free themselves from the landowner
 It would be necessary to communalize the railways, that the citizens might get food and work, and lastly, to prevent the waste of supplies; and to guard against the trusts of corn-speculators, like those to whom the Paris Commune of 1793 fell a prey, it would have to place in the hands of the City the work of stocking its warehouses with commodities, and apportioning the produce
  Some Socialists still seek, however, to establish a distinction
 "Of course," they say, "the soil, the mines, the mills, and manufacturers must be expropriated, these are the instruments of production, and it is right we should consider them public property
 But articles of consumption--food, clothes, and dwellings--should remain private property
"  Popular common sense has got the better of this subtle distinction
 We are not savages who can live in the woods, without other shelter than the branches
 The civilized man needs a roof, a room, a hearth, and a bed
 It is true that the bed, the room, and the house is a home of idleness for the non-producer
 But for the worker, a room, properly heated and lighted, is as much an instrument of production as the tool or the machine
 It is the place where the nerves and sinews gather strength for the work of the morrow
 The rest of the workman is the daily repairing of the machine
  The same argument applies even more obviously to food
 The so-called economists, who make the just-mentioned distinction, would hardly deny that the coal burnt in a machine is as necessary to production as the raw material itself
 How then can food, without which the human machine could do no work, be excluded from the list of things indispensable to the producer? Can this be a relic of religious metaphysics? The rich man's feast is indeed a matter of luxury, but the food of the worker is just as much a part of production as the fuel burnt by the steam-engine
  The same with clothing
 We are not New Guinea savages
 And if the dainty gowns of our ladies must rank as objects of luxury, there is nevertheless a certain quantity of linen, cotton, and woolen stuff which is a necessity of life to the producer
 The shirt and trousers in which he goes to his work, the jacket he slips on after the day's toil is over, are as necessary to him as the hammer to the anvil
  Whether we like it or not, this is what the people mean by a revolution
 As soon as they have made a clean sweep of the Government, they will seek first of all to ensure to themselves decent dwellings and sufficient food and clothes--free of capitalist rent
  And the people will be right
 The methods of the people will be much more in accordance with science than those of the economists who draw so many distinctions between instruments of production and articles of consumption
 The people understand that this is just the point where the Revolution ought to begin; and they will lay the foundations of the only economic science worthy the name--a science which might be called: "_The Study of the Needs of Humanity, and of the Economic Means to satisfy them_
"  FOOTNOTE:  [2] "Shabble of a Duke" is an expression coined by Carlyle; it is a somewhat free rendering of Kropotkine's "Monsieur le Vicomte," but I think it expresses his meaning
--_Trans
_     CHAPTER V  FOOD   I  If the coming Revolution is to be a Social Revolution, it will be distinguished from all former uprisings not only by its aim, but also by its methods
 To attain a new end, new means are required
  The three great popular movements which we have seen in France during the last hundred years differ from each other in many ways, but they have one common feature
  In each case the people strove to overturn the old regime, and spent their heart's blood for the cause
 Then, after having borne the brunt of the battle, they sank again into obscurity
 A Government, composed of men more or less honest, was formed and undertook to organize a new regime: the Republic in 1793, Labour in 1848, the Free Commune in 1871
 Imbued with Jacobin ideas, this Government occupied itself first of all with political questions, such as the reorganization of the machinery of government, the purifying of the administration, the separation of Church and State, civic liberty, and such matters
 It is true the workmen's clubs kept an eye on the members of the new Government, and often imposed their ideas on them
 But even in these clubs, whether the leaders belonged to the middle or the working classes, it was always middle-class ideas which prevailed
 They discussed various political questions at great length, but forgot to discuss the question of bread
  Great ideas sprang up at such times, ideas that have moved the world; words were spoken which still stir our hearts, at the interval of more than a century
 But the people were starving in the slums
  From the very Commencement of the Revolution industry inevitably came to a stop--the circulation of produce was checked, and capital concealed itself
 The master--the employer--had nothing to fear at such times, he fattened on his dividends, if indeed he did not speculate on the wretchedness around; but the wage-earner was reduced to live from hand to mouth
 Want knocked at the door
  Famine was abroad in the land--such famine as had hardly been seen under the old regime
  "The Girondists are starving us!" was the cry in the workmen's quarters in 1793, and thereupon the Girondists were guillotined, and full powers were given to "the Mountain" and to the Commune
 The Commune indeed concerned itself with the question of bread, and made heroic efforts to feed Paris
 At Lyons, Fouché and Collot d'Herbois established city granaries, but the sums spent on filling them were woefully insufficient
 The town councils made great efforts to procure corn; the bakers who hoarded flour were hanged--and still the people lacked bread
  Then they turned on the royalist conspirators and laid the blame at their door
 They guillotined a dozen or fifteen a day--servants and duchesses alike, especially servants, for the duchesses had gone to Coblentz
 But if they had guillotined a hundred dukes and viscounts every day, it would have been equally hopeless
  The want only grew
 For the wage-earner cannot live without his wage, and the wage was not forthcoming
 What difference could a thousand corpses more or less make to him?  Then the people began to grow weary
 "So much for your vaunted Revolution! You are more wretched than ever before," whispered the reactionary in the ears of the worker
 And little by little the rich took courage, emerged from their hiding-places, and flaunted their luxury in the face of the starving multitude
 They dressed up like scented fops and said to the workers: "Come, enough of this foolery! What have you gained by your Revolution?"  And, sick at heart, his patience at an end, the revolutionary had at last to admit to himself that the cause was lost once more
 He retreated into his hovel and awaited the worst
  Then reaction proudly asserted itself, and accomplished a counter-revolutionary stroke
 The Revolution dead, nothing remained but to trample its corpse under foot
  The White Terror began
 Blood flowed like water, the guillotine was never idle, the prisons were crowded, while the pageant of rank and fashion resumed its old course, and went on as merrily as before
  This picture is typical of all our revolutions
 In 1848 the workers of Paris placed "three months of starvation" at the service of the Republic, and then, having reached the limit of their powers, they made, in June, one last desperate effort--an effort which was drowned in blood
 In 1871 the Commune perished for lack of combatants
 It had taken measures for the separation of Church and State, but it neglected, alas, until too late, to take measures for providing the people with bread
 And so it came to pass in Paris that _élégantes_ and fine gentlemen could spurn the confederates, and bid them go sell their lives for a miserable pittance, and leave their "betters" to feast at their ease in fashionable restaurants
  At last the Commune saw its mistake, and opened communal kitchens
 But it was too late
 Its days were already numbered, and the troops of Versailles were on the ramparts
   "Bread, it is bread that the Revolution needs!"  Let others spend their time in issuing pompous proclamations, in decorating themselves lavishly with official gold lace, and in talking about political liberty!


  Be it ours to see, from the first day of the Revolution to the last, in all the provinces fighting for freedom, that there is not a single man who lacks bread, not a single woman compelled to stand with the wearied crowd outside the bakehouse-door, that haply a coarse loaf may be thrown to her in charity, not a single child pining for want of food
  It has always been the middle-class idea to harangue about "great principles"--great lies rather!  The idea of the people will be to provide bread for all
 And while middle-class citizens, and workmen infested with middle-class ideas admire their own rhetoric in the "Talking Shops," and "practical people" are engaged in endless discussions on forms of government, we, the "Utopian dreamers"--we shall have to consider the question of daily bread
  We have the temerity to declare that all have a right to bread, that there is bread enough for all, and that with this watchword of _Bread for All_ the Revolution will triumph
   II  That we are Utopians is well known
 So Utopian are we that we go the length of believing that the Revolution can and ought to assure shelter, food, and clothes to all--an idea extremely displeasing to middle-class citizens, whatever their party colour, for they are quite alive to the fact that it is not easy to keep the upper hand of a people whose hunger is satisfied
  All the same, we maintain our contention: bread must be found for the people of the Revolution, and the question of bread must take precedence of all other questions
 If it is settled in the interests of the people, the Revolution will be on the right road; for in solving the question of Bread we must accept the principle of equality, which will force itself upon us to the exclusion of every other solution
  It is certain that the coming Revolution--like in that respect to the Revolution of 1848--will burst upon us in the middle of a great industrial crisis
 Things have been seething for half a century now, and can only go from bad to worse
 Everything tends that way--new nations entering the lists of international trade and fighting for possession of the world's markets, wars, taxes ever increasing
 National debts, the insecurity of the morrow, and huge colonial undertakings in every corner of the globe
  There are millions of unemployed workers in Europe at this moment
 It will be still worse when Revolution has burst upon us and spread like fire laid to a train of gunpowder
 The number of the out-of-works will be doubled as soon as the barricades are erected in Europe and the United States
 What is to be done to provide these multitudes with bread?  We do not know whether the folk who call themselves "practical people" have ever asked themselves this question in all its nakedness
 But we do know that they wish to maintain the wage system, and we must therefore expect to have "national workshops" and "public works" vaunted as a means of giving food to the unemployed
  Because national workshops were opened in 1789 and 1793; because the same means were resorted to in 1848; because Napoleon III
 succeeded in contenting the Parisian proletariat for eighteen years by giving them public works--which cost Paris to-day its debt of £80,000,000 and its municipal tax of three or four pounds a-head;[3] because this excellent method of "taming the beast" was customary in Rome, and even in Egypt four thousand years ago; and lastly, because despots, kings, and emperors have always employed the ruse of throwing a scrap of food to the people to gain time to snatch up the whip--it is natural that "practical" men should extol this method of perpetuating the wage system
 What need to rack our brains when we have the time-honoured method of the Pharaohs at our disposal?  Yet should the Revolution be so misguided as to start on this path, it would be lost
  In 1848, when the national workshops were opened on February 27, the unemployed of Paris numbered only 8,000; a fortnight later they had already increased to 49,000
 They would soon have been 100,000, without counting those who crowded in from the provinces
  Yet at that time trade and manufacturers in France employed half as many hands as to-day
 And we know that in time of Revolution exchange and industry suffer most from the general upheaval
 We have only to think, indeed, of the number of workmen whose labour depends directly or indirectly upon export trade, or of the number of hands employed in producing luxuries, whose consumers are the middle-class minority
  A revolution in Europe means, then, the unavoidable stoppage of at least half the factories and workshops
 It means millions of workers and their families thrown on the streets
 And our "practical men" would seek to avert this truly terrible situation by means of national relief works; that is to say, by means of new industries created on the spot to give work to the unemployed!  It is evident, as Proudhon had already pointed out more than fifty years ago, that the smallest attack upon property will bring in its train the complete disorganization of the system based upon private enterprise and wage labour
 Society itself will be forced to take production in hand, in its entirety, and to reorganize it to meet the needs of the whole people
 But this cannot be accomplished in a day, or even in a month; it must take a certain time to reorganize the system of production, and during this time millions of men will be deprived of the means of subsistence
 What then is to be done?  There is only one really _practical_ solution of the problem--boldly to face the great task which awaits us, and instead of trying to patch up a situation which we ourselves have made untenable, to proceed to reorganize production on a new basis
  Thus the really practical course of action, in our view, would be that the people should take immediate possession of all the food of the insurgent communes, keeping strict account of it all, that none might be wasted, and that by the aid of these accumulated resources every one might be able to tide over the crisis
 During that time an agreement would have to be made with the factory workers, the necessary raw material given them, and the means of subsistence assured to them, while they worked to supply the needs of the agricultural population
 For we must not forget that while France weaves silks and satins to deck the wives of German financiers, the Empress of Russia, and the Queen of the Sandwich Islands, and while Paris fashions wonderful trinkets and playthings for rich folk all the world over, two-thirds of the French peasantry have not proper lamps to give them light, or the implements necessary for modern agriculture
 Lastly, unproductive land, of which there is plenty, would have to be turned to the best advantage, poor soils enriched, and rich soils, which yet, under the present system, do not yield a quarter, no, nor a tenth of what they might produce, would be submitted to intensive culture, and tilled with as much care as a market garden or a flower pot
 It is impossible to imagine any other practical solution of the problem; and, whether we like it or not, sheer force of circumstances will bring it to pass
   III  The most prominent characteristic of our present capitalism is _the wage system_, which in brief amounts to this:--  A man, or a group of men, possessing the necessary capital, starts some industrial enterprise; he undertakes to supply the factory or workshops with raw material, to organize production, to pay the employes a fixed wage, and lastly, to pocket the surplus value or profits, under pretext of recouping himself for managing the concern, for running the risks it may involve, and for the fluctuations of price in the market value of the wares
  To preserve this system, those who now monopolize capital would be ready to make certain concessions; to share, for example, a part of the profits with the workers, or rather to establish a "sliding scale," which would oblige them to raise wages when prices were high; in brief they would consent to certain sacrifices on condition that they were still allowed to direct industry and to take its first fruits
  Collectivism, as we know, does not abolish the wage system, though it introduces considerable modifications into the existing order of things
 It only substitutes the State, that is to say, some form of Representative Government, national or local, for the individual employer of labour
 Under Collectivism it is the representatives of the nation, or of the Commune, and their deputies and officials who are to have the control of industry
 It is they who reserve to themselves the right of employing the surplus of production--in the interests of all
 Moreover, Collectivism draws a very subtle but very far-reaching distinction between the work of the labourer and of the man who has learned a craft
 Unskilled labour in the eyes of the collectivist is _simple_ labour, while the work of the craftsman, the mechanic, the engineer, the man of science, etc
, is what Marx calls _complex_ labour, and is entitled to a higher wage
 But labourers and craftsmen, weavers and men of science, are all wage-servants of the State--"all officials," as was said lately, to gild the pill
  Well, then, the coming Revolution could render no greater service to humanity than by making the wage system, in all its forms, an impossibility, and by rendering Communism, which is the negation of wage-slavery, the only possible solution
  For even admitting that the Collectivist modification of the present system is possible, if introduced gradually during a period of prosperity and peace--though for my part I question its practicability even under such conditions--it would become impossible in a period of Revolution, when the need of feeding hungry millions would spring up with the first call to arms
 A political revolution can be accomplished without shaking the foundations of industry, but a revolution where the people lay hands upon property will inevitably paralyse exchange and production
 The millions of public money flowing into the Treasury would not suffice for paying wages to the millions of out-of-works
  This point cannot be too much insisted upon; the reorganization of industry on a new basis (and we shall presently show how tremendous this problem is) cannot be accomplished in a few days; nor, on the other hand, will the people submit to be half starved for years in order to oblige the theorists who uphold the wage system
 To tide over the period of stress they will demand what they have always demanded in such cases--communization of supplies--the giving of rations
  It will be in vain to preach patience
 The people will be patient no longer, and if food is not forthcoming they will plunder the bakeries
  Then, if the people are not strong enough to carry all before them, they will be shot down, to give Collectivism a fair field for experiment
 To this end "_order_" must be maintained at any price--order, discipline, obedience! And as the capitalists will soon realize that when the people are shot down by those who call themselves Revolutionists, the Revolution itself will become hateful in the eyes of the masses, they will certainly lend their support to the champions of _order_--even though they are collectivists
 In such a line of conduct, the capitalists will see a means of hereafter crushing the collectivists in their turn
 And if "order is established" in this fashion, the consequences are easy to foresee
 Not content with shooting down the "marauders," the faction of "order" will search out the "ringleaders of the mob
" They will set up again the law courts and reinstate the hangman
 The most ardent revolutionists will be sent to the scaffold
 It will be 1793 over again
  Do not let us forget how reaction triumphed in the last century
 First the "Hébertists" and "the madmen," were guillotined--those whom Mignet, with the memory of the struggle fresh upon him, still called "Anarchists
" The Dantonists soon followed them; and when the party of Robespierre had guillotined these revolutionaries, they in their turn had to mount the scaffold; whereupon the people, sick of bloodshed, and seeing the revolution lost, threw up the sponge, and let the reactionaries do their worst
  If "order is restored," we say, the social democrats will hang the anarchists; the Fabians will hang the social democrats, and will in their turn be hanged by the reactionaries; and the Revolution will come to an end
  But everything confirms us in the belief that the energy of the people will carry them far enough, and that, when the Revolution takes place, the idea of anarchist Communism will have gained ground
 It is not an artificial idea
 The people themselves have breathed it in our ear, and the number of communists is ever increasing, as the impossibility of any other solution becomes more and more evident
  And if the impetus of the people is strong enough, affairs will take a very different turn
 Instead of plundering the bakers' shops one day, and starving the next, the people of the insurgent cities will take possession of the warehouses, the cattle markets,--in fact of all the provision stores and of all the food to be had
 The well-intentioned citizens, men and women both, will form themselves into bands of volunteers and address themselves to the task of making a rough general inventory of the contents of each shop and warehouse
  If such a revolution breaks out in France, namely in Paris, then in twenty-four hours the Commune will know what Paris has not found out yet, in spite of its statistical committees, and what it never did find out during the siege of 1871--the quantity of provisions it contains
 In forty-eight hours millions of copies will be printed of the tables giving a sufficiently exact account of the available food, the places where it is stored, and the means of distribution
  In every block of houses, in every street, in every town ward, groups of volunteers will have been organized, and these commissariat volunteers will find it easy to work in unison and keep in touch with each other
 If only the Jacobin bayonets do not get in the way; if only the self-styled "scientific" theorists do not thrust themselves in to darken counsel! Or rather let them expound their muddle-headed theories as much as they like, provided they have no authority, no power! And that admirable spirit of organization inherent in the people, above all in every social grade of the French nation, but which they have so seldom been allowed to exercise, will initiate, even in so huge a city as Paris, and in the midst of a Revolution, an immense guild of free workers, ready to furnish to each and all the necessary food
  Give the people a free hand, and in ten days the food service will be conducted with admirable regularity
 Only those who have never seen the people hard at work, only those who have passed their lives buried among the documents, can doubt it
 Speak of the organizing genius of the "Great Misunderstood," the people, to those who have seen it in Paris in the days of the barricades, or in London during the great dockers' strike, when half a million of starving folk had to be fed, and they will tell you how superior it is to the official ineptness of Bumbledom
  And even supposing we had to endure a certain amount of discomfort and confusion for a fortnight or a month, surely that would not matter very much
 For the mass of the people it would still be an improvement on their former condition; and, besides, in times of Revolution one can dine contentedly enough on a bit of bread and cheese while eagerly discussing events
  In any case, a system which springs up spontaneously, under stress of immediate need, will be infinitely preferable to anything invented between four walls by hide-bound theorists sitting on any number of committees
   IV  The people of the great towns will be driven by force of circumstances to take possession of all the provisions, beginning with the barest necessaries, and gradually extending Communism to other things, in order to satisfy the needs of all the citizens
 The sooner it is done the better; the sooner it is done the less misery there will be and the less strife
  But upon what basis must society be organized in order that all may have their due share of food produce? This is the question that meets us at the outset
  We answer that there are no two ways of it
 There is only one way in which Communism can be established equitably, only one way which satisfies our instincts of justice and is at the same time practical; namely, the system already adopted by the agrarian communes of Europe
  Take for example a peasant commune, no matter where, even in France, where the Jacobins have done their best to destroy all communal usage
 If the commune possesses woods and copses, then, so long as there is plenty of wood for all, every one can take as much as he wants, without other let or hindrance than the public opinion of his neighbours
 As to the timber-trees, which are always scarce, they have to be carefully apportioned
  The same with the communal pasture land; while there is enough and to spare, no limit is put to what the cattle of each homestead may consume, nor to the number of beasts grazing upon the pastures
 Grazing grounds are not divided, nor is fodder doled out, unless there is scarcity
 All the Swiss communes, and scores of thousands in France and Germany, wherever there is communal pasture land, practise this system
  And in the countries of Eastern Europe, where there are great forests and no scarcity of land, you will find the peasants felling the trees as they need them, and cultivating as much of the soil as they require, without any thought of limiting each man's share of timber or of land
 But the timber will be allowanced, and the land parcelled out, to each household according to its needs, as soon as either becomes scarce, as is already the case in Russia
  In a word, the system is this: no stint or limit to what the community possesses in abundance, but equal sharing and dividing of those commodities which are scarce or apt to run short
 Of the 350 millions who inhabit Europe, 200 millions still follow this system of natural Communism
  It is a fact worth remarking that the same system prevails in the great towns in the distribution of one commodity at least, which is found in abundance, the water supplied to each house
  As long as there is no fear of the supply running short, no water company thinks of checking the consumption of water in each house
 Take what you please! But during the great droughts, if there is any fear of the supply failing, the water companies know that all they have to do is to make known the fact, by means of a short advertisement in the papers, and the citizens will reduce their consumption of water and not let it run to waste
  But if water were actually scarce, what would be done? Recourse would be had to a system of rations
 Such a measure is so natural, so inherent in common sense, that Paris twice asked to be put on rations during the two sieges which it underwent in 1871
  Is it necessary to go into details, to prepare tables, showing how the distribution of rations may work, to prove that it is just and equitable, infinitely more just and equitable than the existing state of things? All these tables and details will not serve to convince those of the middle classes, nor, alas, those of the workers tainted with middle-class prejudices, who regard the people as a mob of savages ready to fall upon and devour each other, as soon as the Government ceases to direct affairs
 But those only who have never seen the people resolve and act on their own initiative could doubt for a moment that if the masses were masters of the situation, they would distribute rations to each and all in strictest accordance with justice and equity
  If you were to give utterance, in any gathering of people, to the opinion that delicacies--game and such-like--should be reserved for the fastidious palates of aristocratic idlers, and black bread given to the sick in the hospitals, you would be hissed
 But say at the same gathering, preach at the street corners and in the market places, that the most tempting delicacies ought to be kept for the sick and feeble--especially for the sick
 Say that if there are only five brace of partridge in the entire city, and only one case of sherry, they should go to sick people and convalescents
 Say that after the sick come the children
 For them the milk of the cows and goats should be reserved if there is not enough for all
 To the children and the aged the last piece of meat, and to the strong man dry bread, if the community be reduced to that extremity
  Say, in a word, that if this or that article of consumption runs short, and has to be doled out, to those who have most need most should be given
 Say that and see if you do not meet with universal agreement
  The man who is full-fed does not understand this, but the people do understand, and have always understood it; and even the child of luxury, if he is thrown on the street and comes into contact with the masses, even he will learn to understand
  The theorists--for whom the soldier's uniform and the barrack mess table are civilization's last word--would like no doubt to start a regime of National Kitchens and "Spartan Broth
" They would point out the advantages thereby gained, the economy in fuel and food, if such huge kitchens were established, where every one could come for their rations of soup and bread and vegetables
  We do not question these advantages
 We are well aware that important economies have already been achieved in this direction--as, for instance, when the handmill, or quern, and the baker's oven attached to each house were abandoned
 We can see perfectly well that it would be more economical to cook broth for a hundred families at once, instead of lighting a hundred separate fires
 We know, besides, that there are a thousand ways of preparing potatoes, but that cooked in one huge pot for a hundred families they would be just as good
  We know, in fact, that variety in cooking being a matter of the seasoning introduced by each cook or housewife, the cooking together of a hundredweight of potatoes would not prevent each cook or housewife from dressing and serving them in any way she pleased
 And we know that stock made from meat can be converted into a hundred different soups to suit a hundred different tastes
  But though we are quite aware of all these facts, we still maintain that no one has a right to force a housewife to take her potatoes from the communal kitchen ready cooked if she prefers to cook them herself in her own pot on her own fire
 And, above all, we should wish each one to be free to take his meals with his family, or with his friends, or even in a restaurant, if it seemed good to him
  Naturally large public kitchens will spring up to take the place of the restaurants, where people are poisoned nowadays
 Already the Parisian housewife gets the stock for her soup from the butcher, and transforms it into whatever soup she likes, and London housekeepers know that they can have a joint roasted, or an apple or rhubarb tart baked at the baker's for a trifling sum, thus economizing time and fuel
 And when the communal kitchen--the common bakehouse of the future--is established, and people can get their food cooked without the risk of being cheated or poisoned, the custom will no doubt become general of going to the communal kitchen for the fundamental parts of the meal, leaving the last touches to be added as individual taste shall suggest
  But to make a hard and fast rule of this, to make a duty of taking home our food ready cooked, that would be as repugnant to our modern minds as the ideas of the convent or the barrack--morbid ideas born in brains warped by tyranny or superstition
  Who will have a right to the food of the commune? will assuredly be the first question which we shall have to ask ourselves
 Every township will answer for itself, and we are convinced that the answers will all be dictated by the sentiment of justice
 Until labour is reorganized, as long as the disturbed period lasts, and while it is impossible to distinguish between inveterate idlers and genuine workers thrown out of work, the available food ought to be shared by all without exception
 Those who have been enemies to the new order will hasten of their own accord to rid the commune of their presence
 But it seems to us that the masses of the people, which have always been magnanimous, and have nothing of vindictiveness in their disposition, will be ready to share their bread with all who remain with them, conquered and conquerers alike
 It will be no loss to the Revolution to be inspired by such an idea, and, when work is set agoing again, the antagonists of yesterday will stand side by side in the same workshops
 A society where work is free will have nothing to fear from idlers
  "But provisions will run short in a month!" our critics at once exclaim
  "So much the better," say we
 It will prove that for the first time on record the people have had enough to eat
 As to the question of obtaining fresh supplies, we shall discuss the means in our next chapter
   V  By what means could a city in a state of revolution be supplied with food? We shall answer this question, but it is obvious that the means resorted to will depend on the character of the Revolution in the provinces, and in neighbouring countries
 If the entire nation, or, better still, if all Europe should accomplish the Social Revolution simultaneously, and start with thorough-going Communism, our procedure would be simplified; but if only a few communities in Europe make the attempt, other means will have to be chosen
 The circumstances will dictate the measures
  We are thus led, before we proceed further, to glance at the State of Europe, and, without pretending to prophesy, we may try to foresee what course the Revolution will take, or at least what will be its essential features
  Certainly it would be very desirable that all Europe should rise at once, that expropriation should be general, and that communistic principles should inspire all and sundry
 Such a universal rising would do much to simplify the task of our century
  But all the signs lead us to believe that it will not take place
 That the Revolution will embrace Europe we do not doubt
 If one of the four great continental capitals--Paris, Vienna, Brussels, or Berlin--rises in revolution and overturns its Government, it is almost certain that the three others will follow its example within a few weeks' time
 It is, moreover, highly probable that the Peninsulas and even London and St
 Petersburg would not be long in following suit
 But whether the Revolution would everywhere exhibit the same characteristics is highly doubtful
  It is more than probable that expropriation will be everywhere carried into effect on a larger scale, and that this policy carried out by any one of the great nations of Europe will influence all the rest; yet the beginnings of the Revolution will exhibit great local differences, and its course will vary in different countries
 In 1789-93, the French peasantry took four years to finally rid themselves of the redemption of feudal rights, and the bourgeois to overthrow royalty
 Let us keep that in mind, and therefore be prepared to see the Revolution develop itself somewhat gradually
 Let us not be disheartened if here and there its steps should move less rapidly
 Whether it would take an avowedly socialist character in all European nations, at any rate at the beginning, is doubtful
 Germany, be it remembered, is still realizing its dream of a United Empire
 Its advanced parties see visions of a Jacobin Republic like that of 1848, and of the organization of labour according to Louis Blanc; while the French people, on the other hand, want above all things a free Commune, whether it be a communist Commune or not
  There is every reason to believe that, when the coming Revolution takes place, Germany will go further than France went in 1793
 The eighteenth-century Revolution in France was an advance on the English Revolution of the seventeenth, abolishing as it did at one stroke the power of the throne and the landed aristocracy, whose influence still survives in England
 But, if Germany goes further and does greater things than France did in 1793, there can be no doubt that the ideas which will foster the birth of her Revolution will be those of 1848; while the ideas which will inspire the Revolution in Russia will probably be a combination of those of 1789 with those of 1848
  Without, however, attaching to these forecasts a greater importance than they merit, we may safely conclude this much: the Revolution will take a different character in each of the different European nations; the point attained in the socialization of wealth will not be everywhere the same
  Will it therefore be necessary, as is sometimes suggested, that the nations in the vanguard of the movement should adapt their pace to those who lag behind? Must we wait till the Communist Revolution is ripe in all civilized countries? Clearly not! Even if it were a thing to be desired, it is not possible
 History does not wait for the laggards
  Besides, we do not believe that in any one country the Revolution will be accomplished at a stroke, in the twinkling of an eye, as some socialists dream
[4] It is highly probable that if one of the five or six large towns of France--Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Lille, Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux--were to proclaim the Commune, the others would follow its example, and that many smaller towns would do the same
 Probably also various mining districts and industrial centres would hasten to rid themselves of "owners" and "masters," and form themselves into free groups
  But many country places have not advanced to that point
 Side by side with the revolutionized communes such places would remain in an expectant attitude, and would go on living on the Individualist system
 Undisturbed by visits of the bailiff or the tax-collector, the peasants would not be hostile to the revolutionaries, and thus, while profiting by the new state of affairs, they would defer the settlement of accounts with the local exploiters
 But with that practical enthusiasm which always characterizes agrarian uprisings (witness the passionate toil of 1792) they would throw themselves into the task of cultivating the land, which, freed from taxes and mortgages, would become so much dearer to them
  As to other countries, revolution would break out everywhere, but revolution under divers aspects; in one country State Socialism, in another Federation; everywhere more or less Socialism, not conforming to any particular rule
   VI  Let us now return to our city in revolt, and consider how its citizens can provide foodstuffs for themselves
 How are the necessary provisions to be obtained if the nation as a whole has not accepted Communism? This is the question to be solved
 Take, for example, one of the large French towns--take the capital itself, for that matter
 Paris consumes every year thousands of tons of grain, 400,000 head of oxen, 300,000 calves, 400,000 swine, and more than two millions of sheep, besides great quantities of game
 This huge city devours, besides, more than 20 million pounds of butter, 200 million eggs, and other produce in like proportion
  It imports flour and grain from the United States and from Russia, Hungary, Italy, Egypt, and the Indies; live stock from Germany, Italy, Spain--even Roumania and Russia; and as for groceries, there is not a country in the world that it does not lay under contribution
  Now, let us see how Paris or any other great town could be revictualled by home-grown produce, supplies of which could be readily and willingly sent in from the provinces
  To those who put their trust in "authority" the question will appear quite simple
 They would begin by establishing a strongly centralized Government, furnished with all the machinery of coercion--the police, the army, the guillotine
 This Government would draw up a statement of all the produce contained in France
 It would divide the country into districts of supply, and then _command_ that a prescribed quantity of some particular foodstuff be sent to such a place on such a day, and delivered at such a station, to be there received on a given day by a specified official and stored in particular warehouses
  Now, we declare with the fullest conviction, not merely that such a solution is undesirable, but that it never could by any possibility be put into practice
 It is wildly Utopian!  Pen in hand, one may dream such a dream in the study, but in contact with reality it comes to nothing,--this was proved in 1793; for, like all such theories, it leaves out of account the spirit of independence that is in man
 The attempt would lead to a universal uprising, to three or four _Vendées_, to the villages rising against the towns, all the country up in arms defying the city for its arrogance in attempting to impose such a system upon the country
  We have already had too much of Jacobin Utopias! Let us see if some other form of organization will meet the case
  During the great French Revolution, the provinces starved the large towns, and killed the Revolution
 And yet it is a known fact that the production of grain in France during 1792-3 had not diminished; indeed, the evidence goes to show that it had increased
 But after having taken possession of the manorial lands, after having reaped a harvest from them, the peasants would not part with their grain for paper-money
 They withheld their produce, waiting for a rise in the price, or the introduction of gold
 The most rigorous measures of the National Convention were without avail, and her executions failed to break up the ring, or force the farmers to sell their corn
 For it is a matter of history that the commissaries of the Convention did not scruple to guillotine those who withheld their grain from the market, and pitilessly executed those who speculated in foodstuffs
 All the same, the corn was not forthcoming, and the townsfolk suffered from famine
  But what was offered to the husbandman in exchange for his hard toil? _Assignats_, scraps of paper decreasing in value every day, promises of payment, which could not be kept
 A forty-pound note would not purchase a pair of boots, and the peasant, very naturally, was not anxious to barter a year's toil for a piece of paper with which he could not even buy a shirt
  As long as worthless paper-money--whether called assignats or labour notes--is offered to the peasant-producer it will always be the same
 The country will withhold its produce, and the towns will suffer want, even if the recalcitrant peasants are guillotined as before
  We must offer to the peasant in exchange for his toil not worthless paper-money, but the manufactured articles of which he stands in immediate need
 He lacks the proper implements to till the land, clothes to protect him from the inclemencies of the weather, lamps and oil to replace his miserable rushlight or tallow dip, spades, rakes, ploughs
 All these things, under present conditions, the peasant is forced to do without, not because he does not feel the need of them, but because, in his life of struggle and privation, a thousand useful things are beyond his reach; because he has not money to buy them
  Let the town apply itself, without loss of time, to manufacturing all that the peasant needs, instead of fashioning geegaws for the wives of rich citizens
 Let the sewing machines of Paris be set to work on clothes for the country folk workaday clothes and clothes for Sunday too, instead of costly evening dresses for the English and Russian landlords and the African gold-magnates' wives
 Let the factories and foundries turn out agricultural implements, spades, rakes, and such-like, instead of waiting till the English send them to France, in exchange for French wines!  Let the towns send no more inspectors to the villages, wearing red, blue, or rainbow-coloured scarves, to convey to the peasant orders to take his produce to this place or that, but let them send friendly embassies to the countryfolk and bid them in brotherly fashion: "Bring us your produce, and take from our stores and shops all the manufactured articles you please
"--Then provisions would pour in on every side
 The peasant would only withhold what he needed for his own use, and would send the rest into the cities, feeling _for the first time in the course of history_ that these toiling townsfolk were his comrades--his brethren, and not his exploiters
  We shall be told, perhaps, that this would necessitate a complete transformation of industry
 Well, yes, that is true of certain departments; but there are other branches which could be rapidly modified in such a way as to furnish the peasant with clothes, watches, furniture, and the simple implements for which the towns make him pay such exorbitant prices at the present time
 Weavers, tailors, shoemakers, tinsmiths, cabinet-makers, and many other trades and crafts could easily direct their energies to the manufacture of useful and necessary articles, and abstain from producing mere luxuries
 All that is needed is that the public mind should be thoroughly convinced of the necessity of this transformation, and should come to look upon it as an act of justice and of progress, and that it should no longer allow itself to be cheated by that dream, so dear to the theorists--the dream of a revolution which confines itself to taking possession of the profits of industry, and leaves production and commerce just as they are now
  This, then, is our view of the whole question
 Cheat the peasant no longer with scraps of paper--be the sums inscribed upon them ever so large; but offer him in exchange for his produce the very _things_ of which he, the tiller of the soil, stands in need
 Then the fruits of the land will be poured into the towns
 If this is not done there will be famine in our cities, and reaction and despair will follow in its train
   VII  All the great towns, we have said, buy their grain, their flour, and their meat, not only from the provinces, but also from abroad
 Foreign countries send Paris not only spices, fish, and various dainties, but also immense quantities of corn and meat
  But when the Revolution comes these cities will have to depend on foreign countries as little as possible
 If Russian wheat, Italian or Indian rice, and Spanish or Hungarian wines abound in the markets of western Europe, it is not that the countries which export them have a superabundance, or that such a produce grows there of itself, like the dandelion in the meadows
 In Russia for instance, the peasant works sixteen hours a day, and half starves from three to six months every year, in order to export the grain with which he pays the landlord and the State
 To-day the police appears in the Russian village as soon as the harvest is gathered in, and sells the peasant's last horse and last cow for arrears of taxes and rent due to the landlord, unless the victim immolates himself of his own accord by selling the grain to the exporters
 Usually, rather than part with his livestock at a disadvantage, he keeps only a nine-months' supply of grain, and sells the rest
 Then, in order to sustain life until the next harvest, he mixes birch-bark and tares with his flour for three months, if it has been a good year, and for six months if it has been bad, while in London they are eating biscuits made of his wheat
  But as soon as the Revolution comes, the Russian peasant will keep bread enough for himself and his children; the Italian and Hungarian peasants will do the same; the Hindoo, let us hope, will profit by these good examples; and the farmers of America will hardly be able to cover all the deficit in grain which Europe will experience
 So it will not do to count on their contributions of wheat and maize satisfying all the wants
  Since all our middle-class civilization is based on the exploitation of inferior races and countries with less advanced industrial systems, the Revolution will confer a boon at the very outset, by menacing that "civilization," and allowing the so-called inferior races to free themselves
  But this great benefit will manifest itself by a steady and marked diminution of the food supplies pouring into the great cities of western Europe
  It is difficult to predict the course of affairs in the provinces
 On the one hand the slave of the soil will take advantage of the Revolution to straighten his bowed back
 Instead of working fourteen or fifteen hours a day, as he does at present, he will be at liberty to work only half that time, which of course would have the effect of decreasing the production of the principal articles of consumption--grain and meat
  But, on the other hand, there will be an increase of production as soon as the peasant realizes that he is no longer forced to support the idle rich by his toil
 New tracts of land will be cleared, new and improved machines set a-going
  "Never was the land so energetically cultivated as in 1792, when the peasant had taken back from the landlord the soil which he had coveted so long," Michelet tells us speaking of the Great Revolution
  Of course, before long, intensive culture would be within the reach of all
 Improved machinery, chemical manures, and all such matters would soon be supplied by the Commune
 But everything tends to indicate that at the outset there would be a falling off in agricultural products, in France and elsewhere
  In any case it would be wisest to count upon such a falling off of contributions from the provinces as well as from abroad
--How is this falling off to be made good?  Why! by setting to work ourselves! No need to rack our brains for far-fetched panaceas when the remedy lies close at hand
  The large towns, as well as the villages, must undertake to till the soil
 We must return to what biology calls "the integration of functions"--after the division of labour, the taking up of it as a whole--this is the course followed throughout Nature
  Besides, philosophy apart, the force of circumstances would bring about this result
 Let Paris see that at the end of eight months it will be running short of bread, and Paris will set to work to grow wheat
  Land will not be wanting, for it is round the great towns, and round Paris especially, that the parks and pleasure grounds of the landed gentry are to be found
 These thousands of acres only await the skilled labour of the husbandman to surround Paris with fields infinitely more fertile and productive than the steppes of southern Russia, where the soil is dried up by the sun
 Nor will labour be lacking
 To what should the two million citizens of Paris turn their attention, when they would be no longer catering for the luxurious fads and amusements of Russian princes, Roumanian grandees, and wives of Berlin financiers?  With all the mechanical inventions of the century; with all the intelligence and technical skill of the worker accustomed to deal with complicated machinery; with inventors, chemists, professors of botany, practical botanists like the market gardeners of Gennevilliers; with all the plant that they could use for multiplying and improving machinery; and, finally, with the organizing spirit of the Parisian people, their pluck and energy--with all these at its command, the agriculture of the anarchist Commune of Paris would be a very different thing from the rude husbandry of the Ardennes
  Steam, electricity, the heat of the sun, and the breath of the wind, will ere long be pressed into service
 The steam plough and the steam harrow will quickly do the rough work of preparation, and the soil, thus cleaned and enriched, will only need the intelligent care of man, and of woman even more than man, to be clothed with luxuriant vegetation--not once but three or four times in the year
  Thus, learning the art of horticulture from experts, and trying experiments in different methods on small patches of soil reserved for the purpose, vying with each other to obtain the best returns, finding in physical exercise, without exhaustion or overwork, the health and strength which so often flags in cities,--men, women and children will gladly turn to the labour of the fields, when it is no longer a slavish drudgery, but has become a pleasure, a festival, a renewal of health and joy
  "There are no barren lands; the earth is worth what man is worth"--that is the last word of modern agriculture
 Ask of the earth, and she will give you bread, provided that you ask aright
  A district, though it were as small as the two departments of the Seine and the Seine-et-Oise, and with so great a city as Paris to feed, would be practically sufficient to grow upon it all the food supplies, which otherwise might fail to reach it
  The combination of agriculture and industry, the husbandman and the mechanic in the same individual--this is what anarchist communism will inevitably lead us to, if it starts fair with expropriation
  Let the Revolution only get so far, and famine is not the enemy it will have to fear
 No, the danger which will menace it lies in timidity, prejudice, and half-measures
 The danger is where Danton saw it when he cried to France: "De l'audace, de l'audace, et encore de l'audace
" The bold thought first, and the bold deed will not fail to follow
  FOOTNOTES:  [3] The municipal debt of Paris amounted in 1904 to 2,266,579,100 francs, and the charges for it were 121,000,000 francs
  [4] No fallacy more harmful has ever been spread than the fallacy of a "One-day Revolution," which is propagated in superficial Socialist pamphlets speaking of the Revolution of the 18th of March at Berlin, supposed (which is absolutely wrong) to have given Prussia its representative Government
 We saw well the harm made by such fallacies in Russia in 1905-1907
 The truth is that up to 1871 Prussia, like Russia of the present day, had a scrap of paper which could be described as a "Constitution," but it had no representative Government
 The Ministry imposed upon the nation, up till 1870, the budget it chose to propose
     CHAPTER VI  DWELLINGS   I  Those who have closely watched the growth of Socialist ideas among the workers must have noticed that on one momentous question--the housing of the people--a definite conclusion is being imperceptibly arrived at
 It is a fact that in the large towns of France, and in many of the smaller ones, the workers are coming gradually to the conclusion that dwelling-houses are in no sense the property of those whom the State recognizes as their owners
  This idea has evolved naturally in the minds of the people, and nothing will ever convince them again that the "rights of property" ought to extend to houses
  The house was not built by its owner
 It was erected, decorated and furnished by innumerable workers in the timber yard, the brick field, and the workshop, toiling for dear life at a minimum wage
  The money spent by the owner was not the product of his own toil
 It was amassed, like all other riches, by paying the workers two-thirds or only a half of what was their due
  Moreover--and it is here that the enormity of the whole proceeding becomes most glaring--the house owes its actual value to the profit which the owner can make out of it
 Now, this profit results from the fact that his house is built in a town--that is, in an agglomeration of thousands of other houses, possessing paved streets, bridges, quays, and fine public buildings, well lighted, and affording to its inhabitants a thousand comforts and conveniences unknown in villages; a town in regular communication with other towns, and itself a centre of industry, commerce, science, and art; a town which the work of twenty or thirty generations has made habitable, healthy, and beautiful
  A house in certain parts of Paris is valued at many thousands of pounds sterling, not because thousands of pounds' worth of labour have been expended on that particular house, but because it is in Paris; because for centuries workmen, artists, thinkers, and men of learning and letters have contributed to make Paris what it is to-day--a centre of industry, commerce, politics, art, and science; because Paris has a past; because, thanks to literature, the names of its streets are household words in foreign countries as well as at home; because it is the fruit of eighteen centuries of toil, the work of fifty generations of the whole French nation
  Who, then, can appropriate to himself the tiniest plot of ground, or the meanest building in such a city, without committing a flagrant injustice? Who, then, has the right to sell to any bidder the smallest portion of the common heritage?  On that point, as we have said, the workers begin to be agreed
 The idea of free dwellings showed its existence very plainly during the siege of Paris, when the cry was for an abatement pure and simple of the terms demanded by the landlords
 It appeared again during the Commune of 1871, when the Paris workmen expected the Council of the Commune to decide boldly on the abolition of rent
 And when the New Revolution comes, it will be the first question with which the poor will concern themselves
  Whether in time of revolution or in time of peace, the worker must be housed somehow or other; he must have some sort of roof over his head
 But, however tumble-down and squalid his dwelling may be, there is always a landlord who can evict him
 True, during the Revolution the landlord cannot find bailiffs and police-sergeants to throw the workman's rags and chattels into the street, but who knows what the new Government will do to-morrow? Who can say that it will not call coercion to its aid again, and set the police pack upon the tenant to hound him out of his hovels? Have we not seen the commune of Paris proclaim the remission of rents due up to the first of April only![5] After that, rent had to be paid, though Paris was in a state of chaos, and industry at a standstill; so that the "federate" who had taken arms to defend the independence of Paris had absolutely nothing to depend upon--he and his family--but an allowance of fifteen pence a day!  Now the worker must be made to see clearly that in refusing to pay rent to a landlord or owner he is not simply profiting by the disorganization of authority
 He must understand that the abolition of rent is a recognized principle, sanctioned, so to speak, by popular assent; that to be housed rent-free is a right proclaimed aloud by the people
  Are we going to wait till this measure, which is in harmony with every honest man's sense of justice, is taken up by the few socialists scattered among the middle class elements, of which the Provisionary Government will be composed? If it were so, the people should have to wait long--till the return of reaction, in fact!  This is why, refusing uniforms and badges--those outward signs of authority and servitude--and remaining people among the people, the earnest revolutionists will work side by side with the masses, that the abolition of rent, the expropriation of houses, may become an accomplished fact
 They will prepare the ground and encourage ideas to grow in this direction; and when the fruit of their labours is ripe, the people will proceed to expropriate the houses without giving heed to the theories which will certainly be thrust in their way--theories about paying compensation to landlords, and finding first the necessary funds
  On the day that the expropriation of houses takes place, on that day, the exploited workers will have realized that new times have come, that Labour will no longer have to bear the yoke of the rich and powerful, that Equality has been openly proclaimed, that this Revolution is a real fact, and not a theatrical make-believe, like so many others preceding it
   II  If the idea of expropriation be adopted by the people it will be carried into effect in spite of all the "insurmountable" obstacles with which we are menaced
  Of course, the good folk in new uniforms, seated in the official arm-chairs of the Hôtel de Ville, will be sure to busy themselves in heaping up obstacles
 They will talk of giving compensation to the landlords, of preparing statistics, and drawing up long reports
 Yes, they would be capable of drawing up reports long enough to outlast the hopes of the people, who, after waiting and starving in enforced idleness, and seeing nothing come of all these official researches, would lose heart and faith in the Revolution and abandon the field to the reactionaries
 The new bureaucracy would end by making expropriation hateful in the eyes of all
  Here, indeed, is a rock which might shipwreck our hopes
 But if the people turn a deaf ear to the specious arguments used to dazzle them, and realize that new life needs new conditions, and if they undertake the task themselves, then expropriation can be effected without any great difficulty
  "But how? How can it be done?" you ask us
 We shall try to reply to this question, but with a reservation
 We have no intention of tracing out the plans of expropriation in their smallest details
 We know beforehand that all that any man, or group of men, could suggest to-day would be far surpassed by the reality when it comes
 Man will accomplish greater things, and accomplish them better and by simpler methods than those dictated to him beforehand
 Thus we shall merely indicate the manner by which expropriation _might_ be accomplished without the intervention of Government
 We do not propose to go out of our way to answer those who declare that the thing is impossible
 We confine ourselves to replying that we are not the upholders of any particular method of organization
 We are only concerned to demonstrate that expropriation _could_ be effected by popular initiative, and _could not_ be effected by any other means whatever
  It seems very likely that, as soon as expropriation is fairly started, groups of volunteers will spring up in every district, street, and block of houses, and undertake to inquire into the number of flats and houses which are empty and of those which are overcrowded, the unwholesome slums, and the houses which are too spacious for their occupants and might well be used to house those who are stifled in swarming tenements
 In a few days these volunteers would have drawn up complete lists for the street and the district of all the flats, tenements, family mansions and villa residences, all the rooms and suites of rooms, healthy and unhealthy, small and large, foetid dens and homes of luxury
  Freely communicating with each other, these volunteers would soon have their statistics complete
 False statistics can be manufactured in board rooms and offices, but true and exact statistics must begin with the individual and mount up from the simple to the complex
  Then, without waiting for anyone's leave, those citizens will probably go and find their comrades who were living in miserable garrets and hovels and will say to them simply: "It is a real Revolution this time, comrades, and no mistake about it
 Come to such a place this evening; all the neighbourhood will be there; we are going to redistribute the dwelling-houses
 If you are tired of your slum-garret, come and choose one of the flats of five rooms that are to be disposed of, and when you have once moved in you shall stay, never fear
 The people are up in arms, and he who would venture to evict you will have to answer to them
"  "But every one will want a fine house or a spacious flat!" we are told
--No, you are quite mistaken
 It is not the people's way to clamour for the moon
 On the contrary, every time we have seen them set about repairing a wrong we have been struck by the good sense and instinct for justice which animates the masses
 Have we ever known them demand the impossible? Have we ever seen the people of Paris fighting among themselves while waiting for their rations of bread or firewood during the two sieges or during the terrible years of 1792-1794? The patience and resignation which prevailed among them in 1871 was constantly presented for admiration by the foreign Press correspondents; and yet these patient waiters knew full well that the last comers would have to pass the day without food or fire
  We do not deny that there are plenty of egotistic instincts in isolated individuals
 We are quite aware of it
 But we contend that the very way to revive and nourish these instincts would be to confine such questions as the housing of the people to any board or committee, in fact, to the tender mercies of officialism in any shape or form
 Then indeed all the evil passions spring up, and it becomes a case of who is the most influential person on the board
 The least inequality causes wranglings and recriminations
 If the smallest advantage is given to any one, a tremendous hue and cry is raised--and not without reason
  But if the people themselves, organized by streets, districts, and parishes, undertake to move the inhabitants of the slums into the half-empty dwellings of the middle classes, the trifling inconveniences, the little inequalities will be easily tided over
 Rarely has appeal been made to the good instincts of the masses--only as a last resort, to save the sinking ship in times of revolution--but never has such an appeal been made in vain; the heroism, the self-devotion of the toiler has never failed to respond to it
 And thus it will be in the coming Revolution
  But, when all is said and done, some inequalities, some inevitable injustices, undoubtedly will remain
 There are individuals in our societies whom no great crisis can lift out of the deep mire of egoism in which they are sunk
 The question, however, is not whether there will be injustices or no, but rather how to limit the number of them
  Now all history, all the experience of the human race, and all social psychology, unite in showing that the best and fairest way is to trust the decision to those whom it concerns most nearly
 It is they alone who can consider and allow for the hundred and one details which must necessarily be overlooked in any merely official redistribution
   III  Moreover, it is by no means necessary to make straightway an absolutely equal redistribution of all the dwellings
 There will no doubt be some inconveniences at first, but matters will soon be righted in a society which has adopted expropriation
  When the masons, and carpenters, and all who are concerned in house building, know that their daily bread is secured to them, they will ask nothing better than to work at their old trades a few hours a day
 They will adapt the fine houses, which absorbed the time of a whole staff of servants, for giving shelter to several families, and in a few months homes will have sprung up, infinitely healthier and more conveniently arranged than those of to-day
 And to those who are not yet comfortably housed the anarchist Commune will be able to say: "Patience, comrades! Palaces fairer and finer than any the capitalists built for themselves will spring from the ground of our enfranchised city
 They will belong to those who have most need of them
 The anarchist Commune does not build with an eye to revenues
 These monuments erected to its citizens, products of the collective spirit, will serve as models to all humanity; they will be yours
"  If the people of the Revolution expropriate the houses and proclaim free lodgings--the communalizing of houses and the right of each family to a decent dwelling--then the Revolution will have assumed a communistic character from the first, and started on a course from which it will be by no means easy to turn it
 It will have struck a fatal blow at individual property
  For the expropriation of dwellings contains in germ the whole social revolution
 On the manner of its accomplishment depends the character of all that follows
 Either we shall start on a good road leading straight to anarchist communism, or we shall remain sticking in the mud of despotic individualism
  It is easy to see the numerous objections--theoretic on the one hand, practical on the other--with which we are sure to be met
 As it will be a question of maintaining iniquity at any price, our opponents will of course protest "in the name of justice
" "Is it not a crying shame," they will exclaim, "that the people of Paris should take possession of all these fine houses, while the peasants in the country have only tumble-down huts to live in?" But do not let us make a mistake
 These enthusiasts for justice forget, by a lapse of memory to which they are subject, the "crying shame" which they themselves are tacitly defending
 They forget that in this same city the worker, with his wife and children, suffocates in a noisome garret, while from his window he sees the rich man's palace
 They forget that whole generations perish in crowded slums, starving for air and sunlight, and that to redress this injustice ought to be the first task of the Revolution
  Do not let these disingenuous protests hold us back
 We know that any inequality which may exist between town and country in the early days of the Revolution will be transitory and of a nature that will right itself from day to day; for the village will not fail to improve its dwellings as soon as the peasant has ceased to be the beast of burden of the farmer, the merchant, the money-lender, and the State
 In order to avoid an accidental and transitory inequality, shall we stay our hand from righting an ancient wrong?  The so-called practical objections are not very formidable either
 We are bidden to consider the hard case of some poor fellow who by dint of privation has contrived to buy a house just large enough to hold his family
 And we are going to deprive him of his hard-earned happiness, to turn him into the street! Certainly not
 If his house is only just large enough for his family, by all means let him stay there
 Let him work in his little garden, too; our "boys" will not hinder him--nay, they will lend him a helping hand if need be
 But suppose he lets lodgings, suppose he has empty rooms in his house; then the people will make the lodger understand that he need not pay his former landlord any more rent
 Stay where you are, but rent free
 No more duns and collectors; Socialism has abolished all that!  Or again, suppose that the landlord has a score of rooms all to himself, and some poor woman lives near by with five children in one room
 In that case the people would see whether, with some alterations, these empty rooms could not be converted into a suitable home for the poor woman and her five children
 Would not that be more just and fair than to leave the mother and her five little ones languishing in a garret, while Sir Gorgeous Midas sat at his ease in an empty mansion? Besides, good Sir Gorgeous would probably hasten to do it of his own accord; his wife will be delighted to be freed from half her big, unwieldy house when there is no longer a staff of servants to keep it in order
  "So you are going to turn everything upside down," say the defenders of law and order
 "There will be no end to the evictions and removals
 Would it not be better to start fresh by turning everybody out of doors and redistributing the houses by lot?" Thus our critics; but we are firmly persuaded that if no Government interferes in the matter, if all the changes are entrusted to these free groups which have sprung up to undertake the work, the evictions and removals will be less numerous than those which take place in one year under the present system, owing to the rapacity of landlords
  In the first place, there are in all large towns almost enough empty houses and flats to lodge all the inhabitants of the slums
 As to the palaces and suites of fine apartments, many working people would not live in them if they could
 One could not "keep up" such houses without a large staff of servants
 Their occupants would soon find themselves forced to seek less luxurious dwellings
 The fine ladies would find that palaces were not well adapted to self-help in the kitchen
 Gradually people would shake down
 There would be no need to conduct Dives to a garret at the bayonet's point, or install Lazarus in Dives's palace by the help of an armed escort
 People would shake down amicably into the available dwellings with the least possible friction and disturbance
 Have we not the example of the village communes redistributing fields and disturbing the owners of the allotments so little that one can only praise the intelligence and good sense of the methods they employ? Fewer fields change hands under the management of the Russian Commune than where personal property holds sway, and is for ever carrying its quarrels into courts of law
 And are we to believe that the inhabitants of a great European city would be less intelligent and less capable of organization than Russian or Hindoo peasants?  Moreover, we must not blink at the fact that every revolution means a certain disturbance to everyday life, and those who expect this tremendous climb out of the old grooves to be accomplished without so much as jarring the dishes on their dinner tables will find themselves mistaken
 It is true that Governments can change without disturbing worthy citizens at dinner, but the crimes of society towards those who have nourished and supported it are not to be redressed by any such political sleight of parties
  Undoubtedly there will be a disturbance, but it must not be one of pure loss; it must be minimized
 And again--it is impossible to lay too much stress on this maxim--it will be by addressing ourselves to the interested parties, and not to boards and committees, that we shall best succeed in reducing the sum of inconveniences for everybody
  The people commit blunder on blunder when they have to choose by ballot some hare-brained candidate who solicits the honour of representing them, and takes upon himself to know all, to do all, and to organize all
 But when they take upon themselves to organize what they know, what touches them directly, they do it better than all the "talking-shops" put together
 Is not the Paris Commune an instance in point? and the great dockers' strike? and have we not constant evidence of this fact in every village commune?  FOOTNOTE:  [5] The decree of the 30 March: by this decree rents due up to the terms of October, 1870, and January and April, 1871, were annulled
     CHAPTER VII  CLOTHING   When the houses have become the common heritage of the citizens, and when each man has his daily supply of food, another forward step will have to be taken
 The question of clothing will of course demand consideration next, and again the only possible solution will be to take possession, in the name of the people, of all the shops and warehouses where clothing is sold or stored, and to throw open the doors to all, so that each can take what he needs
 The communalization of clothing--the right of each to take what he needs from the communal stores, or to have it made for him at the tailors and outfitters--is a necessary corollary of the communalization of houses and food
  Obviously we shall not need for that to despoil all citizens of their coats, to put all the garments in a heap and draw lots for them, as our critics, with equal wit and ingenuity, suggest
 Let him who has a coat keep it still--nay, if he have ten coats it is highly improbable that any one will want to deprive him of them, for most folk would prefer a new coat to one that has already graced the shoulders of some fat bourgeois; and there will be enough new garments, and to spare, without having recourse to second-hand wardrobes
  If we were to take an inventory of all the clothes and stuff for clothing accumulated in the shops and stores of the large towns, we should find probably that in Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, and Marseilles, there was enough to enable the commune to offer garments to all the citizens, of both sexes; and if all were not suited at once, the communal outfitters would soon make good these shortcomings
 We know how rapidly our great tailoring and dressmaking establishments work nowadays, provided as they are with machinery specially adapted for production on a large scale
  "But every one will want a sable-lined coat or a velvet gown!" exclaim our adversaries
  Frankly, we do not believe it
 Every woman does not dote on velvet nor does every man dream of sable linings
 Even now, if we were to ask each woman to choose her gown, we should find some to prefer a simple, practical garment to all the fantastic trimmings the fashionable world affects
  Tastes change with the times, and the fashion in vogue at the time of the Revolution will certainly make for simplicity
 Societies, like individuals, have their hours of cowardice, but also their heroic moments; and though the society of to-day cuts a very poor figure sunk in the pursuit of narrow personal interests and second-rate ideas, it wears a different air when great crises come
 It has its moments of greatness and enthusiasm
 Men of generous nature will gain the power which to-day is in the hand of jobbers
 Self-devotion will spring up, and noble deeds beget their like; even the egotists will be ashamed of hanging back, and will be drawn in spite of themselves to admire, if not to imitate, the generous and brave
  The great Revolution of 1793 abounds in examples of this kind, and it is always during such times of spiritual revival--as natural to societies as to individuals--that the spring-tide of enthusiasm sweeps humanity onwards
  We do not wish to exaggerate the part played by such noble passions, nor is it upon them that we would found our ideal of society
 But we are not asking too much if we expect their aid in tiding over the first and most difficult moments
 We cannot hope that our daily life will be continuously inspired by such exalted enthusiasms, but we may expect their aid at the first, and that is all we need
  It is just to wash the earth clean, to sweep away the shards and refuse, accumulated by centuries of slavery and oppression, that the new anarchist society will have need of this wave of brotherly love
 Later on it can exist without appealing to the spirit of self-sacrifice, because it will have eliminated oppression, and thus created a new world instinct with all the feelings of solidarity
  Besides, should the character of the Revolution be such as we have sketched here, the free initiative of individuals would find an extensive field of action in thwarting the efforts of the egotists
 Groups would spring up in every street and quarter to undertake the charge of the clothing
 They would make inventories of all that the city possessed, and would find out approximately what were the resources at their disposal
 It is more than likely that in the matter of clothing the citizens would adopt the same principle as in the matter of provisions--that is to say, they would offer freely from the common store everything which was to be found in abundance, and dole out whatever was limited in quantity
  Not being able to offer to each man a sable-lined coat and to every woman a velvet gown, society would probably distinguish between the superfluous and the necessary, and, provisionally at least class sable and velvet among the superfluities of life, ready to let time prove whether what is a luxury to-day may not become common to all to-morrow
 While the necessary clothing would be guaranteed to each inhabitant of the anarchist city, it would be left to private activity to provide for the sick and feeble those things, provisionally considered as luxuries, and to procure for the less robust such special articles, as would not enter into the daily consumption of ordinary citizens
  "But," it may be urged, "this means grey uniformity and the end of everything beautiful in life and art
"  "Certainly not," we reply
 And, still basing our reasonings on what already exists, we are going to show how an Anarchist society could satisfy the most artistic tastes of its citizens without allowing them to amass the fortunes of millionaires
     CHAPTER VIII  WAYS AND MEANS   I  If a society, a city or a territory were to guarantee the necessaries of life to its inhabitants (and we shall see how the conception of the necessaries of life can be so extended as to include luxuries), it would be compelled to take possession of what is absolutely needed for production; that is to say--land, machinery, factories, means of transport, etc
 Capital in the hands of private owners would be expropriated, to be returned to the community
  The great harm done by bourgeois society, as we have already mentioned, is not only that capitalists seize a large share of the profits of each industrial and commercial enterprise, thus enabling themselves to live without working, but that all production has taken a wrong direction, as it is not carried on with a view to securing well-being to all
 There is the reason why it must be condemned
  It is absolutely impossible that mercantile production should be carried on in the interest of all
 To desire it would be to expect the capitalist to go beyond his province and to fulfil duties that he _cannot_ fulfil without ceasing to be what he is--a private manufacturer seeking his own enrichment
 Capitalist organization, based on the personal interest of each individual employer of labour, has given to society all that could be expected of it: it has increased the productive force of Labour
 The capitalist, profiting by the revolution effected in industry by steam, by the sudden development of chemistry and machinery, and by other inventions of our century, has worked in his own interest to increase the yield of human labour, and in a great measure he has succeeded so far
 But to attribute other duties to him would be unreasonable
 For example, to expect that he should use this superior yield of labour in the interest of society as a whole, would be to ask philanthropy and charity of him, and a capitalist enterprise cannot be based on charity
  It now remains for society, first, to extend this greater productivity, which is limited to certain industries, and to apply it to the general good
 But it is evident that to utilize this high productivity of labour, so as to guarantee well-being to all, Society must itself take possession of all means of production
  Economists, as is their wont, will not fail to remind us of the comparative well-being of a certain category of young robust workmen, skilled in certain special branches of industry which has been obtained under the present system
 It is always this minority that is pointed out to us with pride
 But even this well-being, which is the exclusive right of a few, is it secure? To-morrow, maybe, negligence, improvidence, or the greed of their employers, will deprive these privileged men of their work, and they will pay for the period of comfort they have enjoyed with months and years of poverty or destitution
 How many important industries--the textiles, iron, sugar, etc
--without mentioning all sorts of short-lived trades, have we not seen decline or come to a standstill on account of speculations, or in consequence of natural displacement of work, or from the effects of competition amongst the capitalists themselves! If the chief textile and mechanical industries had to pass through such a crisis as they have passed through in 1886, we hardly need mention the small trades, all of which have their periods of standstill
  What, too, shall we say to the price which is paid for the relative well-being of certain categories of workmen? Unfortunately, it is paid for by the ruin of agriculture, the shameless exploitation of the peasants, the misery of the masses
 In comparison with the feeble minority of workers who enjoy a certain comfort, how many millions of human beings live from hand to mouth, without a secure wage, ready to go wherever they are wanted; how many peasants work fourteen hours a day for a poor pittance! Capital depopulates the country, exploits the colonies and the countries where industries are but little developed, dooms the immense majority of workmen to remain without technical education, to remain mediocre even in their own trade
  This is not merely accidental, it is a _necessity_ of the capitalist system
 In order well to remunerate certain classes of workmen, peasants _must_ become the beasts of burden of society; the country _must_ be deserted for the town; small trades must agglomerate in the foul suburbs of large cities, and manufacture a thousand little things for next to nothing, so as to bring the goods of the greater industries within reach of buyers with small salaries
 That bad cloth may be sold to ill-paid workers, garments are made by tailors who are satisfied with a starvation wage! Eastern lands in a backward state are exploited by the West, in order that, under the capitalist system, workers in a few privileged industries may obtain certain limited comforts of life
  The evil of the present system is therefore not that the "surplus-value" of production goes to the capitalist, as Rodbertus and Marx said, thus narrowing the Socialist conception and the general view of the capitalist system; the surplus-value itself is but a consequence of deeper causes
 The evil lies _in the possibility of a surplus-value existing_, instead of a simple surplus not consumed by each generation; for, that a surplus-value should exist, means that men, women and children are compelled by hunger to sell their labour for a small part of what this labour produces, and still more so, of what their labour is capable of producing: But this evil will last as long as the instruments of production belong to the few
 As long as men are compelled to pay a heavy tribute to property holders for the right of cultivating land or putting machinery into action, and the owners of the land and the machine are free to produce what bids fair to bring them in the largest profits--rather than the greatest amount of useful commodities--well-being can only be temporarily guaranteed to a very few; it is only to be bought by the poverty of a large section of society
 It is not sufficient to distribute the profits realized by a trade in equal parts, if at the same time thousands of other workers are exploited
 It is a case of PRODUCING THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GOODS NECESSARY TO THE WELL-BEING OF ALL, WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE WASTE OF HUMAN ENERGY
  This generalized aim cannot be the aim of a private owner; and this is why society as a whole, if it takes this view of production as its ideal, will be compelled to expropriate all that enhances well-being while producing wealth
 It will have to take possession of land, factories, mines, means of communication, etc
, and besides, it will have to study what products will promote general well-being, as well as the ways and means of an adequate production
   II  How many hours a day will man have to work to produce nourishing food, a comfortable home, and necessary clothing for his family? This question has often preoccupied Socialists, and they generally came to the conclusion that four or five hours a day would suffice, on condition, be it well understood, that all men work
 At the end of last century, Benjamin Franklin fixed the limit at five hours; and if the need of comfort is greater now, the power of production has augmented too, and far more rapidly
  In speaking of agriculture further on, we shall see what the earth can be made to yield to man when he cultivates it in a reasonable way, instead of throwing seed haphazard in a badly ploughed soil as he mostly does to-day
 In the great farms of Western America, some of which cover 30 square miles, but have a poorer soil than the manured soil of civilized countries, only 10 to 15 English bushels per English acre are obtained; that is to say, half the yield of European farms or of American farms in the Eastern States
 And nevertheless, thanks to machines which enable 2 men to plough 4 English acres a day, 100 men can produce in a year all that is necessary to deliver the bread of 10,000 people at their homes during a whole year
  Thus it would suffice for a man to work under the same conditions for _30 hours, say 6 half-days of five hours each, to have bread for a whole year_; and to work 30 half-days to guarantee the same to a family of 5 people
  We shall also prove by results obtained nowadays, that if we took recourse to intensive agriculture, less than 6 half-days' work could procure bread, meat, vegetables, and even luxurious fruit for a whole family
  Again, if we study the cost of workmen's dwellings, built in large towns to-day, we can ascertain that to obtain, in a large English city, a semi-detached little house, as they are built for workmen for £250, from 1400 to 1800 half-days' work of 5 hours would be sufficient
 And as a house of that kind lasts 50 years at least, it follows that 28 to 36 half-days' work a year would provide well-furnished, healthy quarters, with all necessary comfort for a family
 Whereas when hiring the same apartment from an employer, a workman pays from 75 to 100 days' work per year
  Mark that these figures represent the maximum of what a house costs in England to-day, being given the defective organization of our societies
 In Belgium, workmen's houses in the _cités ouvrières_ have been built at a much smaller cost
 So that, taking everything into consideration, we are justified in affirming that in a well-organized society 30 or 40 half-days' work a year will suffice to guarantee a perfectly comfortable home
  There now remains clothing, the exact value of which is almost impossible to fix, because the profits realized by a swarm of middlemen cannot be estimated
 Let us take cloth, for example, and add up all the tribute levied on every yard of it by the landowners, the sheep owners, the wool merchants, and all their intermediate agents, then by the railway companies, mill-owners, weavers, dealers in ready-made clothes, sellers and commission agents, and we shall get then an idea of what we pay to a whole swarm of capitalists for each article of clothing
 That is why it is perfectly impossible to say how many days' work an overcoat that you pay £3 or £4 for in a large London shop represents
  What is certain is that with present machinery it is possible to manufacture an incredible amount of goods both cheaply and quickly
  A few examples will suffice
 Thus in the United States, in 751 cotton mills (for spinning and weaving), 175,000 men and women produce 2,033,000,000 yards of cotton goods, besides a great quantity of thread
 On the average, more than 12,000 yards of cotton goods alone are obtained by a 300 days' work of nine and one-half hours each, say 40 yards of cotton in 10 hours
 Admitting that a family needs 200 yards a year at most, this would be equivalent to 50 hours' work, say _10 half-days of 5 hours each_
 And we should have thread besides; that is to say, cotton to sew with, and thread to weave cloth with, so as to manufacture woolen stuffs mixed with cotton
  As to the results obtained by weaving alone, the official statistics of the United States teach us that in 1870, if workmen worked 13 or 14 hours a day, they made 10,000 yards of white cotton goods in a year; sixteen years later (1886) they wove 30,000 yards by working only 55 hours a week
  Even in printed cotton goods they obtained, weaving and printing included, 32,000 yards in 2670 hours of work a year--say about 12 yards an hour
 Thus to have your 200 yards of white and printed cotton goods _17 hours' work a year_ would suffice
 It is necessary to remark that raw material reaches these factories in about the same state as it comes from the fields, and that the transformations gone through by the piece before it is converted into goods are completed in the course of these 17 hours
 But to _buy_ these 200 yards from the tradesman, a well-paid workman must give _at the very least_ 10 to 15 days' work of 10 hours each, say 100 to 150 hours
 And as to the English peasant, he would have to toil for a month, or a little more, to obtain this luxury
  By this example we already see that by working _50 half-days per year_ in a well-organized society we could dress better than the lower middle classes do to-day
  But with all this we have only required 60 half-days' work of 5 hours each to obtain the fruits of the earth, 40 for housing, and 50 for clothing, which only makes half a year's work, as the year consists of 300 working-days if we deduct holidays
  There remain still 150 half-days' work which could be made use of for other necessaries of life--wine, sugar, coffee, tea, furniture, transport, etc
, etc
  It is evident that these calculations are only approximative, but they can also be proved in another way
 When we take into account how many, in the so-called civilized nations, produce nothing, how many work at harmful trades, doomed to disappear, and lastly, how many are only useless middlemen, we see that in each nation the number of real producers could be doubled
 And if, instead of every 10 men, 20 were occupied in producing useful commodities, and if society took the trouble to economize human energy, those 20 people would only have to work 5 hours a day without production decreasing
 And it would suffice to reduce the waste of human energy which is going on in the rich families with the scores of useless servants, or in the administrations which occupy one official to every ten or even six inhabitants, and to utilize those forces, to augment immensely the productivity of a nation
 In fact, work could be reduced to four or even three hours a day, to produce all the goods that are produced now
  After studying all these facts together, we may arrive, then, at the following conclusion: Imagine a society, comprising a few million inhabitants, engaged in agriculture and a great variety of industries--Paris, for example, with the Department of Seine-et-Oise
 Suppose that in this society all children learn to work with their hands as well as with their brains
 Admit that all adults, save women, engaged in the education of their children, bind themselves to work _5 hours a day_ from the age of twenty or twenty-two to forty-five or fifty, and that they follow occupations they have chosen themselves in any one of those branches of human work which in this city are considered _necessary_
 Such a society could in return guarantee well-being to all its members, a well-being more substantial than that enjoyed to-day by the middle classes
 And, moreover, each worker belonging to this society would have at his disposal at least 5 hours a day which he could devote to science, art, and individual needs which do not come under the category of _necessities_, but will probably do so later on, when man's productivity will have augmented, and those objects will no longer appear luxurious or inaccessible
     CHAPTER IX  THE NEED FOR LUXURY   I  Man is not a being whose exclusive purpose in life is eating, drinking, and providing a shelter for himself
 As soon as his material wants are satisfied, other needs, which, generally speaking, may be described as of an artistic character, will thrust themselves forward
 These needs are of the greatest variety; they vary with each and every individual; and the more society is civilized, the more will individuality be developed, and the more will desires be varied
  Even to-day we see men and women denying themselves necessaries to acquire mere trifles, to obtain some particular gratification, or some intellectual or material enjoyment
 A Christian or an ascetic may disapprove of these desires for luxury; but it is precisely these trifles that break the monotony of existence and make it agreeable
 Would life, with all its inevitable drudge and sorrows, be worth living, if, besides daily work, man could never obtain a single pleasure according to his individual tastes?  If we wish for a Social Revolution, it is no doubt, first of all, to give bread to everyone; to transform this execrable society, in which we can every day see capable workmen dangling their arms for want of an employer who will exploit them; women and children wandering shelterless at night; whole families reduced to dry bread; men, women, and children dying for want of care and even for want of food
 It is to put an end to these iniquities that we rebel
  But we expect more from the Revolution
 We see that the worker, compelled to struggle painfully for bare existence, is reduced to ignore the higher delights, the highest within man's reach, of science, and especially of scientific discovery; of art, and especially of artistic creation
 It is in order to obtain for all of us joys that are now reserved to a few; in order to give leisure and the possibility of developing everyone's intellectual capacities, that the social revolution must guarantee daily bread to all
 After bread has been secured, leisure is the supreme aim
  No doubt, nowadays, when hundreds and thousands of human beings are in need of bread, coal, clothing, and shelter, luxury is a crime; to satisfy it, the worker's child must go without bread! But in a society in which all have the necessary food and shelter, the needs which we consider luxuries to-day will be the more keenly felt
 And as all men do not and cannot resemble one another (the variety of tastes and needs is the chief guarantee of human progress) there will always be, and it is desirable that there should always be, men and women whose desire will go beyond those of ordinary individuals in some particular direction
  Everybody does not need a telescope, because, even if learning were general, there are people who prefer to examine things through a microscope to studying the starry heavens
 Some like statues, some like pictures
 A particular individual has no other ambition than to possess a good piano, while another is pleased with an accordion
 The tastes vary, but the artistic needs exist in all
 In our present, poor capitalistic society, the man who has artistic needs cannot satisfy them unless he is heir to a large fortune, or by dint of hard work appropriates to himself an intellectual capital which will enable him to take up a liberal profession
 Still he cherishes the _hope_ of some day satisfying his tastes more or less, and for this reason he reproaches the idealist Communist societies with having the material life of each individual as their sole aim
 "In your communal stores you may perhaps have bread for all," he says to us, "but you will not have beautiful pictures, optical instruments, luxurious furniture, artistic jewelry--in short, the many things that minister to the infinite variety of human tastes
 And you suppress the possibility of obtaining anything besides the bread and meat which the commune can offer to all, and the drab linen in which all your lady citizens will be dressed
"  These are the objections which all communist systems have to consider, and which the founders of new societies, established in American deserts, never understood
 They believed that if the community could procure sufficient cloth to dress all its members, a music-room in which the "brothers" could strum a piece of music, or act a play from time to time, it was enough
 They forgot that the feeling for art existed in the agriculturist as well as in the burgher, and, notwithstanding that the expression of artistic feeling varies according to the difference in culture, in the main it remains the same
 In vain did the community guarantee the common necessaries of life, in vain did it suppress all education that would tend to develop individuality, in vain did it eliminate all reading save the Bible
 Individual tastes broke forth, and caused general discontent; quarrels arose when somebody proposed to buy a piano or scientific instruments; and the elements of progress flagged
 The society could only exist on condition that it crushed all individual feeling, all artistic tendency, and all development
  Will the anarchist Commune be impelled by the same direction?--Evidently not, if it understands that while it produces all that is necessary to material life, it must also strive to satisfy all manifestations of the human mind
   II  We frankly confess that when we think of the abyss of poverty and suffering that surrounds us, when we hear the heartrending cry of the worker walking the streets begging for work, we are loth to discuss the question: How will men act in a society, whose members are properly fed, to satisfy certain individuals desirous of possessing a piece of Sèvres china or a velvet dress?  We are tempted to answer: Let us make sure of bread to begin with, we shall see to china and velvet later on
  But as we must recognize that man has other needs besides food, and as the strength of Anarchy lies precisely in that that it understands _all_ human faculties and _all_ passions, and ignores none, we shall, in a few words, explain how man can contrive to satisfy all his intellectual and artistic needs
  We have already mentioned that by working 4 or 5 hours a day till the age of forty-five or fifty, man could easily produce _all_ that is necessary to guarantee comfort to society
  But the day's work of a man accustomed to toil does not consist of 5 hours; it is a 10 hours' day for 300 days a year, and lasts all his life
 Of course, when a man is harnessed to a machine, his health is soon undermined and his intelligence is blunted; but when man has the possibility of varying occupations, and especially of alternating manual with intellectual work, he can remain occupied without fatigue, and even with pleasure, for 10 or 12 hours a day
 Consequently, the man who will have done the 4 or 5 hours of manual work that are necessary for his existence, will have before him 5 or 6 hours which he will seek to employ according to his tastes
 And these 5 or 6 hours a day will fully enable him to procure for himself, if he associates with others, all he wishes for, in addition to the necessaries guaranteed to all
  He will discharge first his task in the field, the factory, and so on, which he owes to society as his contribution to the general production
 And he will employ the second half of his day, his week, or his year, to satisfy his artistic or scientific needs, or his hobbies
  Thousands of societies will spring up to gratify every taste and every possible fancy
  Some, for example, will give their hours of leisure to literature
 They will then form groups comprising authors, compositors, printers, engravers, draughtsmen, all pursuing a common aim--the propagation of ideas that are dear to them
  Nowadays an author knows that there is a beast of burden, the worker, to whom, for the sum of a few shillings a day, he can entrust the printing of his books; but he hardly cares to know what a printing office is like
 If the compositor suffers from lead-poisoning, and if the child who sees to the machine dies of anæmia, are there not other poor wretches to replace them?  But when there will be no more starvelings ready to sell their work for a pittance, when the exploited worker of to-day will be educated, and will have his _own_ ideas to put down in black and white and to communicate to others, then the authors and scientific men will be compelled to combine among themselves and with the printers, in order to bring out their prose and their poetry
  So long as men consider fustian and manual labour a mark of inferiority, it will appear amazing to them to see an author setting up his own book in type, for has he not a gymnasium or games by way of diversion? But when the opprobrium connected with manual labor has disappeared, when all will have to work with their hands, there being no one to do it for them, then the authors as well as their admirers will soon learn the art of handling composing-sticks and type; they will know the pleasure of coming together--all admirers of the work to be printed--to set up the type, to shape it into pages, to take it in its virginal purity from the press
 These beautiful machines, instruments of torture to the child who attends on them from morn till night, will be a source of enjoyment for those who will make use of them in order to give voice to the thoughts of their favourite author
  Will literature lose by it? Will the poet be less a poet after having worked out of doors or helped with his hands to multiply his work? Will the novelist lose his knowledge of human nature after having rubbed shoulders with other men in the forest or the factory, in the laying out of a road or on a railway line? Can there be two answers to these questions?  Maybe some books will be less voluminous; but then, more will be said on fewer pages
 Maybe fewer waste-sheets will be published; but the matter printed will be more attentively read and more appreciated
 The book will appeal to a larger circle of better educated readers, who will be more competent to judge
  Moreover, the art of printing, that has so little progressed since Gutenberg, is still in its infancy
 It takes two hours to compose in type what is written in ten minutes, but more expeditious methods of multiplying thought are being sought after and will be discovered
[6]  What a pity every author does not have to take his share in the printing of his works! What progress printing would have already made! We should no longer be using movable letters, as in the seventeenth century
   III  Is it a dream to conceive a society in which--all having become producers, all having received an education that enables them to cultivate science or art, and all having leisure to do so--men would combine to publish the works of their choice, by contributing each his share of manual work? We have already hundreds of learned, literary, and other societies; and these societies are nothing but voluntary groups of men, interested in certain branches of learning, and associated for the purpose of publishing their works
 The authors who write for the periodicals of these societies are not paid, and the periodicals, apart from a limited number of copies, are not for sale; they are sent gratis to all quarters of the globe, to other societies, cultivating the same branches of learning
 This member of the Society may insert in its review a one-page note summarizing his observations; another may publish therein an extensive work, the results of long years of study; while others will confine themselves to consulting the review as a starting-point for further research
 It does not matter: all these authors and readers are associated for the production of works in which all of them take an interest
  It is true that a learned society, like the individual author, goes to a printing office where workmen are engaged to do the printing
 Nowadays, those who belong to the learned societies despise manual labour which indeed is carried on under very bad conditions; but a community which would give a generous philosophic and _scientific_ education to all its members, would know how to organize manual labour in such a way that it would be the pride of humanity
 Its learned societies would become associations of explorers, lovers of science, and workers--all knowing a manual trade and all interested in science
  If, for example, the Society is studying geology, all will contribute to the exploration of the earth's strata; each member will take his share in research, and ten thousand observers, where we have now only a hundred, will do more in a year than we can do in twenty years
 And when their works are to be published, ten thousand men and women, skilled in different trades, will be ready to draw maps, engrave designs, compose, and print the books
 With gladness will they give their leisure--in summer to exploration, in winter to indoor work
 And when their works appear, they will find not only a hundred, but ten thousand readers interested in their common work
  This is the direction in which progress is already moving
 Even to-day, when England felt the need of a complete dictionary of the English language, the birth of a Littré, who would devote his life to this work, was not waited for
 Volunteers were appealed to, and a thousand men offered their services, spontaneously and gratuitously, to ransack the libraries, to take notes, and to accomplish in a few years a work which one man could not complete in his lifetime
 In all branches of human intelligence the same spirit is breaking forth, and we should have a very limited knowledge of humanity could we not guess that the future is announcing itself in such tentative co-operation, which is gradually taking the place of individual work
  For this dictionary to be a really collective work, it would have been necessary that many volunteer authors, printers, and printers' readers should have worked in common; but something in this direction is done already in the Socialist Press, which offers us examples of manual and intellectual work combined
 It happens in our newspapers that a Socialist author composes in lead his own article
 True, such attempts are rare, but they indicate in which direction evolution is going
  They show the road of liberty
 In future, when a man will have something useful to say--a word that goes beyond the thoughts of his century, he will not have to look for an editor who might advance the necessary capital
 He will look for collaborators among those who know the printing trade, and who approve the idea of his new work
 Together they will publish the new book or journal
  Literature and journalism will cease to be a means of money-making and living at the cost of others
 But is there any one who knows literature and journalism from within, and who does not ardently desire that literature should at last be able to free itself from those who formerly protected it, and who now exploit it, and from the multitude, which, with rare exceptions, pays for it in proportion to its mediocrity, or to the ease with which it adapts itself to the bad taste o£ the greater number?  Letters and science will only take their proper place in the work of human development when, freed from all mercenary bondage, they will be exclusively cultivated by those who love them, and for those who love them
   IV  Literature, science, and art must be cultivated by free men
 Only on this condition will they succeed in emancipating themselves from the yoke of the State, of Capital, and of the bourgeois mediocrity which stifles them
  What means has the scientist of to-day to make researches that interest him? Should he ask help of the State, which can only be given to one candidate in a hundred, and which only he may obtain who promises ostensibly to keep to the beaten track? Let us remember how the Academy of Sciences of France repudiated Darwin, how the Academy of St
 Petersburg treated Mendeléeff with contempt, and how the Royal Society of London refused to publish Joule's paper, in which he determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, finding it "unscientific
"[7]  It was why all great researches, all discoveries revolutionizing science, have been made outside academies and universities, either by men rich enough to remain independent, like Darwin and Lyell, or by men who undermined their health by working in poverty, and often in great straits, losing endless time for want of a laboratory, and unable to procure the instruments or books necessary to continue their researches, but persevering against hope, and often dying before they had reached the end in view
 Their name is legion
  Altogether, the system of help granted by the State is so bad that science has always endeavoured to emancipate itself from it
 For this very reason there are thousands of learned societies organized and maintained by volunteers in Europe and America,--some having developed to such a degree that all the resources of subventioned societies, and all the wealth of millionaires, would not buy their treasures
 No governmental institution is as rich as the Zoological Society of London, which is supported by voluntary contributions
  It does not buy the animals which in thousands people its gardens: they are sent by other societies and by collectors of the entire world
 The Zoological Society of Bombay will send an elephant as a gift; another time a hippopotamus or a rhinoceros is offered by Egyptian naturalists
 And these magnificent presents are pouring in every day, arriving from all quarters of the globe--birds, reptiles, collections of insects, etc
 Such consignments often comprise animals that could not be bought for all the gold in the world; thus a traveller who has captured an animal at life's peril, and now loves it as he would love a child, will give it to the Society because he is sure it will be cared for
 The entrance fee paid by visitors, and they are numberless, suffices for the maintenance of that immense institution
  What is defective in the Zoological Society of London, and in other kindred societies, is that the member's fee cannot be paid in work; that the keepers and numerous employes of this large institution are not recognized as members of the Society, while many have no other incentive to joining the society than to put the cabalistic letters F
Z
S (Fellow of the Zoological Society) on their cards
 In a word, what is needed is a more perfect co-operation
  We may say the same about inventors, that we have said of scientists
 Who does not know what sufferings nearly all great inventions have cost? Sleepless nights, families deprived of bread, want of tools and materials for experiments, this is the history of nearly all those who have enriched industry with inventions which are the truly legitimate pride of our civilization
  But what are we to do to alter the conditions that everybody is convinced are bad? Patents have been tried, and we know with what results
 The inventor sells his patent for a few pounds, and the man who has only lent the capital pockets the enormous profits often resulting from the invention
 Besides, patents isolate the inventor
 They compel him to keep secret his researches which therefore end in failure; whereas the simplest suggestion, coming from a brain less absorbed in the fundamental idea, sometimes suffices to fertilize the invention and make it practical
 Like all State control, patents hamper the progress of industry
 Thought being incapable of being patented, patents are a crying injustice in theory, and in practice they result in one of the great obstacles to the rapid development of invention
  What is needed to promote the spirit of invention is, first of all, the awakening of thought, the boldness of conception, which our entire education causes to languish; it is the spreading of a scientific education, which would increase the number of inquirers a hundredfold; it is faith that humanity is going to take a step forward, because it is enthusiasm, the hope of doing good, that has inspired all the great inventors
 The Social Revolution alone can give this impulse to thought, this boldness, this knowledge, this conviction of working for all
  Then we shall have vast institutes supplied with motor-power and tools of all sorts, immense industrial laboratories open to all inquirers, where men will be able to work out their dreams, after having acquitted themselves of their duty towards society; machinery palaces where they will spend their five or six hours of leisure; where they will make their experiments; where they will find other comrades, experts in other branches of industry, likewise coming to study some difficult problem, and therefore able to help and enlighten each other,--the encounter of their ideas and experience causing the longed-for solution to be found
 And yet again, this is no dream
 Solanóy Gorodók, in Petersburg, has already partially realized it as regards technical matters
 It is a factory well furnished with tools and free to all; tools and motor-power are supplied gratis, only metals and wood are charged for at cost price
 Unfortunately workmen only go there at night when worn out by ten hours' labour in the workshop
 Moreover, they carefully hide their inventions from each other, as they are hampered by patents and Capitalism--that bane of present society, that stumbling-block in the path of intellectual and moral progress
   V  And what about art? From all sides we hear lamentations about the decadence of art
 We are, indeed, far behind the great masters of the Renaissance
 The technicalities of art have recently made great progress; thousands of people gifted with a certain amount of talent cultivate every branch, but art seems to fly from civilization! Technicalities make headway, but inspiration frequents artists' studios less than ever
  Where, indeed, should it come from? Only a grand idea can inspire art
 _Art_ is in our ideal synonymous with creation, it must look ahead; but save a few rare, very rare exceptions, the professional artist remains too philistine to perceive new horizons
  Moreover, this inspiration cannot come from books; it must be drawn from life, and present society cannot arouse it
  Raphael and Murillo painted at a time when the search of a new ideal could be pursued while retaining the old religious traditions
 They painted to decorate churches which themselves represented the pious work of several generations of a given city
 The basilic with its mysterious aspect, its grandeur, was connected with the life itself of the city, and could inspire a painter
 He worked for a popular monument; he spoke to his fellow-citizens, and in return he received inspiration; he appealed to the multitude in the same way as did the nave, the pillars, the stained windows, the statues, and the carved doors
 Nowadays the greatest honour a painter can aspire to is to see his canvas, framed in gilded wood, hung in a museum, a sort of old curiosity shop, where you see, as in the Prado, Murillo's Ascension next to a beggar of Velasquez and the dogs of Philip II
 Poor Velasquez and poor Murillo! Poor Greek statues which _lived_ in the Acropolis of their cities, and are now stifled beneath the red cloth hangings of the Louvre!  When a Greek sculptor chiseled his marble he endeavored to express the spirit and heart of the city
 All its passions, all its traditions of glory, were to live again in the work
 But to-day the _united_ city has ceased to exist; there is no more communion of ideas
 The town is a chance agglomeration of people who do not know one another, who have no common interest, save that of enriching themselves at the expense of one another
 The fatherland does not exist



 What fatherland can the international banker and the rag-picker have in common? Only when cities, territories, nations, or groups of nations, will have renewed their harmonious life, will art be able to draw its inspiration from _ideals held in common_
 Then will the architect conceive the city's monument which will no longer be a temple, a prison, or a fortress; then will the painter, the sculptor, the carver, the ornament-worker know where to put their canvases, their statues, and their decoration; deriving their power of execution from the same vital source, and gloriously marching all together towards the future
  But till then art can only vegetate
 The best canvases of modern artists are those that represent nature, villages, valleys, the sea with its dangers, the mountain with its splendours
 But how can the painter express the poetry of work in the fields if he has only contemplated it, imagined it, if he has never delighted in it himself? If he only knows it as a bird of passage knows the country he soars over in his migrations? If, in the vigour of early youth, he has not followed the plough at dawn, and enjoyed mowing grass with a large sweep of the scythe next to hardy haymakers vying in energy with lively young girls who fill the air with their songs? The love of the soil and of what grows on it is not acquired by sketching with a paint-brush--it is only in its service; and without loving it, how paint it? This is why all that the best painters have produced in this direction is still so imperfect, not true to life, nearly always merely sentimental
 There is no _strength_ in it
  You must have seen a sunset when returning from work
 You must have been a peasant among peasants to keep the splendour of it in your eye
 You must have been at sea with fishermen at all hours of the day and night, have fished yourself, struggled with the waves, faced the storm, and after rough work experienced the joy of hauling a heavy net, or the disappointment of seeing it empty, to understand the poetry of fishing
 You must have spent time in a factory, known the fatigues and the joys of creative work, forged metals by the vivid light of a blast furnace, have felt the life in a machine, to understand the power of man and to express it in a work of art
 You must, in fact, be permeated with popular feelings, to describe them
  Besides, the works of future artists who will have lived the life of the people, like the great artists of the past, will not be destined for sale
 They will be an integral part of a living whole that would not be complete without them, any more than they would be complete without it
 Men will go to the artist's own city to gaze at his work, and the spirited and serene beauty of such creations will produce its beneficial effect on heart and mind
  Art, in order to develop, must be bound up with industry by a thousand intermediate degrees, blended, so to say, as Ruskin and the great Socialist poet Morris have proved so often and so well
 Everything that surrounds man, in the street, in the interior and exterior of public monuments, must be of a pure artistic form
  But this can only be realized in a society in which all enjoy comfort and leisure
 Then only shall we see art associations, of which each member will find room for his capacity; for art cannot dispense with an infinity of purely manual and technical supplementary works
 These artistic associations will undertake to embellish the houses of their members, as those kind volunteers, the young painters of Edinburgh, did in decorating the walls and ceilings of the great hospital for the poor in their city
  A painter or sculptor who has produced a work of personal feeling will offer it to the woman he loves, or to a friend
 Executed for love's sake,--will his work, inspired by love, be inferior to the art that to-day satisfies the vanity of the philistine, because it has cost much money?  The same will be done as regards all pleasures not comprised in the necessaries of life
 He who wishes for a grand piano will enter the association of musical instrument makers
 And by giving the association part of his half-days' leisure, he will soon possess the piano of his dreams
 If he is fond of astronomical studies he will join the association of astronomers, with its philosophers, its observers, its calculators, with its artists in astronomical instruments, its scientists and amateurs, and he will have the telescope he desires by taking his share of the associated work, for it is especially the rough work that is needed in an astronomical observatory--bricklayer's, carpenter's, founder's, mechanic's work, the last touch being given to the instrument of precision by the artist
  In short, the five or seven hours a day which each will have at his disposal, after having consecrated several hours to the production of necessities, would amply suffice to satisfy all longings for luxury, however varied
 Thousands of associations would undertake to supply them
 What is now the privilege of an insignificant minority would be accessible to all
 Luxury, ceasing to be a foolish and ostentatious display of the bourgeois class, would become an artistic pleasure
  Everyone would be the happier for it
 In collective work, performed with a light heart to attain a desired end, a book, a work of art, or an object of luxury, each will find an incentive and the necessary relaxation that makes life pleasant
  In working to put an end to the division between master and slave, we work for the happiness of both, for the happiness of humanity
  FOOTNOTES:  [6] They _have_ already been discovered since the above lines were written
  [7] We know this from Playfair, who mentioned it at Joule's death
     CHAPTER X  AGREEABLE WORK   I  When Socialists maintain that a society, freed from the rule of the capitalists, would make work agreeable, and would suppress all repugnant and unhealthy drudgery, they are laughed at
 And yet even to-day we can see the striking progress that is being made in this direction; and wherever this progress has been achieved, employers congratulate themselves on the economy of energy obtained thereby
  It is evident that a factory could be made as healthy and pleasant as a scientific laboratory
 And it is no less evident that it would be advantageous to make it so
 In a spacious and well-ventilated factory the work is better; it is easy to introduce many small ameliorations, of which each represents an economy of time or of manual labour
 And if most of the workshops we know are foul and unhealthy, it is because the workers are of no account in the organization of factories, and because the most absurd waste of human energy is the distinctive feature of the present industrial organization
  Nevertheless, now and again, we already find, even now, some factories so well managed that it would be a real pleasure to work in them, if the work, be it well understood, were not to last more than four or five hours a day, and if every one had the possibility of varying it according to his tastes
  There are immense works, which I know, in one of the Midland counties, unfortunately consecrated to engines of war
 They are perfect as regards sanitary and intelligent organization
 They occupy fifty English acres of land, fifteen of which are roofed with glass
 The pavement of fire-proof bricks is as clean as that of a miner's cottage, and the glass roof is carefully cleaned by a gang of workmen who do nothing else
 In these works are forged steel ingots or blooms weighing as much as twenty tons; and when you stand thirty feet from the immense furnace, whose flames have a temperature of more than a thousand degrees, you do not guess its presence save when its great doors open to let out a steel monster
 And the monster is handled by only three or four workmen, who now here, now there, open a tap causing immense cranes to move one way or another by the pressure of water
  You enter these works expecting to hear the deafening noise of stampers, and you find that there are no stampers
 The immense hundred-ton guns and the crank-shafts of transatlantic steamers are forged by hydraulic pressure, and the worker has but to turn a tap to give shape to the immense mass of steel, which makes a far more homogeneous metal, without crack or flaw, of the blooms, whatever be their thickness
  I expected an infernal grating, and I saw machines which cut blocks of steel thirty feet long with no more noise than is needed to cut cheese
 And when I expressed my admiration to the engineer who showed us round, he answered--  "A mere question of economy! This machine, that planes steel, has been in use for forty-two years
 It would not have lasted ten years if its parts, badly adjusted, 'interfered' and creaked at each movement of the plane!  "And the blast-furnaces? It would be a waste to let heat escape instead of utilizing it
 Why roast the founders, when heat lost by radiation represents tons of coal?  "The stampers that made buildings shake five leagues off were also waste
 Is it not better to forge by pressure than by impact, and it costs less--there is less loss
  "In these works, light, cleanliness, the space allotted to each bench, are but a simple question of economy
 Work is better done when you can see what you do, and have elbow-room
  "It is true," he said, "we were very cramped before coming here
 Land is so expensive in the vicinity of large towns--landlords are so grasping!"  It is even so in mines
 We know what mines are like nowadays from Zola's descriptions and from newspaper reports
 But the mine of the future will be well ventilated, with a temperature as easily regulated as that of a library; there will be no horses doomed to die below the earth: underground traction will be carried on by means of an automatic cable put into motion at the pit's mouth
 Ventilators will be always working, and there will never be explosions
 This is no dream, such a mine is already to be seen in England; I went down it
 Here again the excellent organization is simply a question of economy
 The mine of which I speak, in spite of its immense depth (466 yards), has an output of a thousand tons of coal a day, with only two hundred miners--five tons a day per each worker, whereas the average for the two thousand pits in England at the time I visited this mine in the early 'nineties, was hardly three hundred tons a year per man
  If necessary, it would be easy to multiply examples proving that as regards the material organization Fourier's dream was not a Utopia
  This question has, however, been so frequently discussed in Socialist newspapers that public opinion should already be educated on this point
 Factory, forge and mine _can_ be as healthy and magnificent as the finest laboratories in modern universities, and the better the organization the more will man's labour produce
  If it be so, can we doubt that work will become a pleasure and a relaxation in a society of equals, in which "hands" will not be compelled to sell themselves to toil, and to accept work under any conditions? Repugnant tasks will disappear, because it is evident that these unhealthy conditions are harmful to society as a whole
 Slaves can submit to them, but free men will create new conditions, and their work will be pleasant and infinitely more productive
 The exceptions of to-day will be the rule of to-morrow
  The same will come to pass as regards domestic work, which to-day society lays on the shoulders of that drudge of humanity--woman
   II  A society regenerated by the Revolution will make domestic slavery disappear--this last form of slavery, perhaps the most tenacious, because it is also the most ancient
 Only it will not come about in the way dreamt of by Phalansterians, nor in the manner often imagined by authoritarian Communists
  Phalansteries are repugnant to millions of human beings
 The most reserved man certainly feels the necessity of meeting his fellows for the purpose of common work, which becomes the more attractive the more he feels himself a part of an immense whole
 But it is not so for the hours of leisure, reserved for rest and intimacy
 The phalanstery and the familystery do not take this into account, or else they endeavour to supply this need by artificial groupings
  A phalanstery, which is in fact nothing but an immense hotel, can please some, and even all at a certain period of their life, but the great mass prefers family life (family life of the future, be it understood)
 They prefer isolated apartments, Anglo-Saxons even going as far as to prefer houses of from six to eight rooms, in which the family, or an agglomeration of friends, can live apart
 Sometimes a phalanstery is a necessity, but it would be hateful, were it the general rule
 Isolation, alternating with time spent in society, is the normal desire of human nature
 This is why one of the greatest tortures in prison is the impossibility of isolation, much as solitary confinement becomes torture in its turn, when not alternated with hours of social life
  As to considerations of economy, which are sometimes laid stress on in favour of phalansteries, they are those of a petty tradesman
 The most important economy, the only reasonable one, is to make life pleasant for all, because the man who is satisfied with his life produces infinitely more than the man who curses his surroundings
[8]  Other Socialists reject the phalanstery
 But when you ask them how domestic work can be organized, they answer: "Each can do 'his own work
' My wife manages the house; the wives of bourgeois will do as much
" And if it is a bourgeois playing at Socialism who speaks, he will add, with a gracious smile to his wife: "Is it not true, darling, that you would do without a servant in the Socialist society? You would work like the wife of our good comrade Paul or the wife of John the carpenter?"  Servant or wife, man always reckons on woman to do the house-work
  But woman, too, at last claims her share in the emancipation of humanity
 She no longer wants to be the beast of burden of the house
 She considers it sufficient work to give many years of her life to the rearing of her children
 She no longer wants to be the cook, the mender, the sweeper of the house! And, owing to American women taking the lead in obtaining their claims, there is a general complaint of the dearth of women who will condescend to domestic work in the United States
 My lady prefers art, politics, literature, or the gaming tables; as to the work-girls, they are few, those who consent to submit to apron-slavery, and servants are only found with difficulty in the States
 Consequently, the solution, a very simple one, is pointed out by life itself
 Machinery undertakes three-quarters of the household cares
  You black your boots, and you know how ridiculous this work is
 What can be more stupid than rubbing a boot twenty or thirty times with a brush? A tenth of the European population must be compelled to sell itself in exchange for a miserable shelter and insufficient food, and woman must consider herself a slave, in order that millions of her sex should go through this performance every morning
  But hairdressers have already machines for brushing glossy or woolly heads of hair
 Why should we not apply, then, the same principle to the other extremity? So it has been done, and nowadays the machine for blacking boots is in general use in big American and European hotels
 Its use is spreading outside hotels
 In large English schools, where the pupils are boarding in the houses of the teachers, it has been found easier to have one single establishment which undertakes to brush a thousand pairs of boots every morning
  As to washing up! Where can we find a housewife who has not a horror of this long and dirty work, that is usually done by hand, solely because the work of the domestic slave is of no account
  In America they do better
 There are already a number of cities in which hot water is conveyed to the houses as cold water is in Europe
 Under these conditions the problem was a simple one, and a woman--Mrs
 Cochrane--solved it
 Her machine washes twelve dozen plates or dishes, wipes them and dries them, in less than three minutes
 A factory in Illinois manufactures these machines and sells them at a price within reach of the average middle-class purse
 And why should not small households send their crockery to an establishment as well as their boots? It is even probable that the two functions, brushing and washing up, will be undertaken by the same association
  Cleaning, rubbing the skin off your hands when washing and wringing linen; sweeping floors and brushing carpets, thereby raising clouds of dust which afterwards occasion much trouble to dislodge from the places where they have settled down, all this work is still done because woman remains a slave, but it tends to disappear as it can be infinitely better done by machinery
 Machines of all kinds will be introduced into households, and the distribution of motor-power in private houses will enable people to work them without muscular effort
  Such machines cost little to manufacture
 If we still pay very much for them, it is because they are not in general use, and chiefly because an exorbitant tax is levied upon every machine by the gentlemen who wish to live in grand style and who have speculated on land, raw material, manufacture, sale, patents, and duties
  But emancipation from domestic toil will not be brought about by small machines only
 Households are emerging from their present state of isolation; they begin to associate with other households to do in common what they did separately
  In fact, in the future we shall not have a brushing machine, a machine for washing up plates, a third for washing linen, and so on, in each house
 To the future, on the contrary, belongs the common heating apparatus that sends heat into each room of a whole district and spares the lighting of fires
 It is already so in a few American cities
 A great central furnace supplies all houses and all rooms with hot water, which circulates in pipes; and to regulate the temperature you need only turn a tap
 And should you care to have a blazing fire in any particular room you can light the gas specially supplied for heating purposes from a central reservoir
 All the immense work of cleaning chimneys and keeping up fires--and woman knows what time it takes--is disappearing
  Candles, lamps, and even gas have had their day
 There are entire cities in which it is sufficient to press a button for light to burst forth, and, indeed, it is a simple question of economy and of knowledge to give yourself the luxury of electric light
 And lastly, also in America, they speak of forming societies for the almost complete suppression of household work
 It would only be necessary to create a department for every block of houses
 A cart would come to each door and take the boots to be blacked, the crockery to be washed up, the linen to be washed, the small things to be mended (if it were worth while), the carpets to be brushed, and the next morning would bring back the things entrusted to it, all well cleaned
 A few hours later your hot coffee and your eggs done to a nicety would appear on your table
 It is a fact that between twelve and two o'clock there are more than twenty million Americans and as many Englishmen who eat roast beef or mutton, boiled pork, potatoes and a seasonable vegetable
 And at the lowest figure eight million fires burn during two or three hours to roast this meat and cook these vegetables; eight million women spend their time preparing a meal which, taking all households, represents at most a dozen different dishes
  "Fifty fires burn," wrote an American woman the other day, "where one would suffice!" Dine at home, at your own table, with your children, if you like; but only think yourself, why should these fifty women waste their whole morning to prepare a few cups of coffee and a simple meal! Why fifty fires, when two people and one single fire would suffice to cook all these pieces of meat and all these vegetables? Choose your own beef or mutton to be roasted if you are particular
 Season the vegetables to your taste if you prefer a particular sauce! But have a single kitchen with a single fire and organize it as beautifully as you are able to
  Why has woman's work never been of any account? Why in every family are the mother and three or four servants obliged to spend so much time at what pertains to cooking? Because those who want to emancipate mankind have not included woman in their dream of emancipation, and consider it beneath their superior masculine dignity to think "of those kitchen arrangements," which they have put on the shoulders of that drudge--woman
  To emancipate woman, is not only to open the gates of the university, the law courts, or the parliaments to her, for the "emancipated" woman will always throw her domestic toil on to another woman
 To emancipate woman is to free her from the brutalizing toil of kitchen and washhouse; it is to organize your household in such a way as to enable her to rear her children, if she be so minded, while still retaining sufficient leisure to take her share of social life
  It will come
 As we have said, things are already improving
 Only let us fully understand that a revolution, intoxicated with the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality, Solidarity, would not be a revolution if it maintained slavery at home
 Half humanity subjected to the slavery of the hearth would still have to rebel against the other half
  FOOTNOTE:  [8] It seems that the Communists of Young Icaria had understood the importance of a free choice in their daily relations apart from work
 The ideal of religious Communists has always been to have meals in common; it is by meals in common that early Christians manifested their adhesion to Christianity
 Communion is still a vestige of it
 Young Icarians had given up this religious tradition
 They dined in a common dining room, but at small separate tables, at which they sat according to the attractions of the moment
 The Communists of Anama have each their house and dine at home, while taking their provisions at will at the communal stores
     CHAPTER XI  FREE AGREEMENT   I  Accustomed as we are by heredity prejudices and our unsound education and training to represent ourselves the beneficial hand of Government, legislation and magistracy everywhere, we have come to believe that man would tear his fellow-man to pieces like a wild beast the day the police took his eye off him; that absolute chaos would come about if authority were overthrown during a revolution
 And with our eyes shut we pass by thousands and thousands of human groupings which form themselves freely, without any intervention of the law, and attain results infinitely superior to those achieved under governmental tutelage
  If you open a daily paper you find that its pages are entirely devoted to Government transactions and to political jobbery
 A man from another world, reading it, would believe that, with the exception of the Stock Exchange transactions, nothing gets done in Europe save by order of some master
 You find nothing in the paper about institutions that spring up, grow up, and develop without ministerial prescription! Nothing--or almost nothing! Even where there is a heading, "Sundry Events" (_Faits divers_, a favorite column in the French papers), it is because they are connected with the police
 A family drama, an act of rebellion, will only be mentioned if the police have appeared on the scene
  Three hundred and fifty million Europeans love or hate one another, work, or live on their incomes; but, apart from literature, theatre, or sport, their lives remain ignored by newspapers if Governments have not intervened in it in some way or other
 It is even so with history
 We know the least details of the life of a king or of a parliament; all good and bad speeches pronounced by the politicians have been preserved: "speeches that have never had the least influence on the vote of a single member," as an old parliamentarian said
 Royal visits, the good or bad humour of politicians, their jokes and intrigues, are all carefully recorded for posterity
 But we have the greatest difficulty to reconstitute a city of the Middle Ages, to understand the mechanism of that immense commerce that was carried on between Hanseatic cities, or to know how the city of Rouen built its cathedral
 If a scholar spends his life in studying these questions, his works remain unknown, and parliamentary histories--that is to say, the defective ones, as they only treat of one side of social life--multiply; they are circulated, they are taught in schools
  In this way we do not even perceive the prodigious work, accomplished every day by spontaneous groups of men, which constitutes the chief work of our century
  We therefore propose to point out some of these most striking manifestations, and to show how men, as soon as their interests do not absolutely clash, act in concert, harmoniously, and perform collective work of a very complex nature
  It is evident that in present society, based on individual property--that is to say, on plunder, and on a narrow-minded, and therefore foolish individualism--facts of this kind are necessarily limited; agreements are not always perfectly free, and often they have a mean, if not execrable aim
  But what concerns us is not to give examples which might be blindly followed, and which, moreover, present society could not possibly give us
 What we have to do is to show that, in spite of the authoritarian individualism which stifles us, there remains in our life, taken as a whole, a very great part in which we only act by free agreement; and that therefore it would be much easier than is usually thought, to dispense with Government
  In support of our view we have already mentioned railways, and we will now return to them
  We know that Europe has a system of railways, over 175,000 miles long, and that on this network you can nowadays travel from north to south, from east to west, from Madrid to Petersburg, and from Calais to Constantinople, without delays, without even changing carriages (when you travel by express)
 More than that: a parcel deposited at a station will find its addressee anywhere, in Turkey or in Central Asia, without more formality needed for sending it than writing its destination on a bit of paper
  This result might have been obtained in two ways
 A Napoleon, a Bismarck, or some potentate having conquered Europe, would from Paris, Berlin, or Rome, draw a railway map and regulate the hours of the trains
 The Russian Tsar Nicholas I
 dreamt of such a power
 When he was shown rough drafts of railways between Moscow and Petersburg, he seized a ruler and drew on the map of Russia a straight line between these two capitals, saying, "Here is the plan
" And the road was built in a straight line, filling in deep ravines, building bridges of a giddy height, which had to be abandoned a few years later, after the railway had cost about £120,000 to £150,000 per English mile
  This is one way, but happily things were managed differently
 Railways were constructed piece by piece, the pieces were joined together, and the hundred different companies, to whom these pieces belonged, gradually came to an understanding concerning the arrival and departure of their trains, and the running of carriages on their rails, from all countries, without unloading merchandise as it passes from one network to another
  All this was done by free agreement, by exchange of letters and proposals, and by congresses at which delegates met to discuss well specified special points, and to come to an agreement about them, but not to make laws
 After the congress was over, the delegates returned to their respective companies, not with a law, but with the draft of a contract to be accepted or rejected
  Of course difficulties were met in the way
 There were obstinate men who would not be convinced
 But a common interest compelled them to agree in the end, without invoking the help of armies against the refractory members
  This immense network of railways connected together, and the enormous traffic it has given rise to, no doubt constitutes the most striking trait of the nineteenth century; and it is the result of free agreement
 If somebody had foretold it eighty years ago, our grandfathers would have thought him idiotic or mad
 They would have said: "Never will you be able to make the shareholders of a hundred companies listen to reason! It is a Utopia, a fairy tale
 A central Government, with an 'iron' dictator, can alone enforce it
"  And the most interesting thing in this organization is, that there is no European Central Government of Railways! Nothing! No minister of railways, no dictator, not even a continental parliament, not even a directing committee! Everything is done by free agreement
  So we ask the believers in the State, who pretend that "we can never do without a central Government, were it only for regulating the traffic," we ask them: "But how do European railways manage without them? How do they continue to convey millions of travellers and mountains of luggage across a continent? If companies owning railways have been able to agree, why should railway workers, who would take possession of railways, not agree likewise? And if the Petersburg-Warsaw Company and that of Paris-Belfort can act in harmony, without giving themselves the luxury of a common commander, why, in the midst of our societies, consisting of groups of free workers, should we need a Government?"   II  When we endeavour to prove by examples that even to-day, in spite of the iniquitous organization of society as a whole, men, provided their interests be not diametrically opposed, agree without the intervention of authority, we do not ignore the objections that will be put forth
  All such examples have their defective side, because it is impossible to quote a single organization exempt from the exploitation of the weak by the strong, the poor by the rich
 This is why the Statists will not fail to tell us with their wonted logic: "You see that the intervention of the State is necessary to put an end to this exploitation!"  Only they forget the lessons of history; they do not tell us to what extent the State itself has contributed towards the existing order by creating proletarians and delivering them up to exploiters
 They forget to prove us that it is possible to put an end to exploitation while the primal causes--private capital and poverty, two-thirds of which are artificially created by the State--continue to exist
  When we speak of the accord established among the railway companies, we expect them, the worshippers of the bourgeois State, to say to us: "Do you not see how the railway companies oppress and ill-use their employees and the travellers! The only way is, that the State should intervene to protect the workers and the public!"  But have we not said and repeated over and over again, that as long as there are capitalists, these abuses of power will be perpetuated? It is precisely the State, the would-be benefactor, that has given to the companies that monopoly and those rights upon us which they possess to-day
 Has it not created concessions, guarantees? Has it not sent its soldiers against railwaymen on strike? And during the first trials (quite lately we saw it still in Russia), has it not extended the privilege of the railway magnates as far as to forbid the Press to mention railway accidents, so as not to depreciate the shares it guaranteed? Has it not favoured the monopoly which has anointed the Vanderbilts and the Polyakoffs, the directors of the P
L
M
, the C
P
R
, the St
 Gothard, "the kings of our days"?  Therefore, if we give as an example the tacit agreement come to between railway companies, it is by no means as an ideal of economical management, nor even an ideal of technical organization
 It is to show that if capitalists, without any other aim than that of augmenting their dividends at other people's expense, can exploit railways successfully without establishing an International Department,--societies of working men will be able to do it just as well, and even better, without nominating a Ministry of European railways
  Another objection is raised that is more serious at first sight
 We may be told that the agreement we speak of is not perfectly _free_, that the large companies lay down the law to the small ones
 It might be mentioned, for example, that a certain rich German company, supported by the State, compel travellers who go from Berlin to Bâle to pass via Cologne and Frankfort, instead of taking the Leipzig route; or that such a company carries goods a hundred and thirty miles in a roundabout way (on a long distance) to favour its influential shareholders, and thus ruins the secondary lines
 In the United States travellers and goods are sometimes compelled to travel impossibly circuitous routes so that dollars may flow into the pocket of a Vanderbilt
  Our answer will be the same: As long as Capital exists, the Greater Capital will oppress the lesser
 But oppression does not result from Capital only
 It is also owing to the support given them by the State, to monopoly created by the State in their favour, that the large companies oppress the small ones
  The early English and French Socialists have shown long since how English legislation did all in its power to ruin the small industries, drive the peasant to poverty, and deliver over to wealthy industrial employers battalions of men, compelled to work for no matter what salary
 Railway legislation did exactly the same
 Strategic lines, subsidized lines, companies which received the International Mail monopoly, everything was brought into play to forward the interests of wealthy financiers
 When Rothschild, creditor to all European States, puts capital in a railway, his faithful subjects, the ministers, will do their best to make him earn more
  In the United States, in the Democracy that authoritarians hold up to us as an ideal, the most scandalous fraudulency has crept into everything that concerns railroads
 Thus, if a company ruins its competitors by cheap fares, it is often enabled to do so because it is reimbursed by land given to it by the State for a gratuity
 Documents recently published concerning the American wheat trade have fully shown up the part played by the State in the exploitation of the weak by the strong
 Here, too, the power of accumulated capital has increased tenfold and a hundredfold by means of State help
 So that, when we see syndicates of railway companies (a product of free agreement) succeeding in protecting their small companies against big ones, we are astonished at the intrinsic force of free agreement that can hold its own against all-powerful Capital favoured by the State
  It is a fact that little companies exist, in spite of the State's partiality
 If in France, land of centralization, we only see five or six large companies, there are more than a hundred and ten in Great Britain who agree remarkably well, and who are certainly better organized for the rapid transit of travellers and goods than the French and German companies
  Moreover, that is not the question
 Large Capital, favoured by the State, can always, _if it be to its advantage_, crush the lesser one
 What is of importance to us is this: The agreement between hundreds of capitalist companies to whom the railways of Europe belong, _was established without intervention of a central government_ to lay down the law to the divers societies; it has subsisted by means of congresses composed of delegates, who discuss among themselves, and submit _proposals_, not _laws_, to their constituents
 It is a new principle that differs completely from all governmental principle, monarchical or republican, absolute or parliamentarian
 It is an innovation that has been timidly introduced into the customs of Europe, but has come to stay
   III  How often have we not read in the writings of State-loving Socialists: "Who, then, will undertake the regulation of canal traffic in the future society? Should it enter the mind of one of your Anarchist 'comrades' to put his barge across a canal and obstruct thousands of boats, who will force him to reason?"  Let us confess the supposition to be somewhat fanciful
 Still, it might be said, for instance: "Should a certain commune, or a group of communes, want to make their barges pass before others, they might perhaps block the canal in order to carry stones, while wheat, needed in another commune, would have to stand by
 Who, then, would regulate the traffic if not the Government?"  But real life has again demonstrated that Government can be very well dispensed with here as elsewhere
 Free agreement, free organization, replace that noxious and costly system, and do better
  We know what canals mean to Holland
 They are its highways
 We also know how much traffic there is on the canals
 What is carried along our highroads and railroads is transported on canal-boats in Holland
 There you could find cause to fight, in order to make your boats pass before others
 There the Government might really interfere to keep the traffic in order
  Yet it is not so
 The Dutch settled matters in a more practical way, long ago, by founding guilds, or syndicates of boatmen
 These were free associations sprung from the very needs of navigation
 The right of way for the boats was adjusted by the order of inscription in a navigation register; they had to follow one another in turn
 Nobody was allowed to get ahead of the others under pain of being excluded from the guild
 None could station more than a certain number of days along the quay; and if the owner found no goods to carry during that time, so much the worse for him; he had to depart with his empty barge to leave room for newcomers
 Obstruction was thus avoided, even though the competition between the private owners of the boats continued to exist
 Were the latter suppressed, the agreement would have been only the more cordial
  It is unnecessary to add that the shipowners could adhere or not to the syndicate
 That was their business, but most of them elected to join it
 Moreover, these syndicates offered such great advantages that they spread also along the Rhine, the Weser, the Oder, and as far as Berlin
 The boatmen did not wait for a great Bismarck to annex Holland to Germany, and to appoint an Ober Haupt General Staats Canal Navigation's Rath (Supreme Head Councillor of the General States Canal Navigation), with a number of gold stripes on his sleeves, corresponding to the length of the title
 They preferred coming to an international understanding
 Besides, a number of shipowners, whose sailing-vessels ply between Germany and Scandinavia, as well as Russia, have also joined these syndicates, in order to regulate traffic in the Baltic, and to bring about a certain harmony in the _chassé-croisé_ of vessels
 These associations have sprung up freely, recruiting volunteer adherents, and have nought in common with governments
  It is, however, more than probable that here too greater capital oppresses lesser
 Maybe the syndicate has also a tendency to become a monopoly, especially where it receives the precious patronage of the State that surely did not fail to interfere with it
 Let us not forget either, that these syndicates represent associations whose members have only private interests at stake, and that if at the same time each shipowner were compelled--by the socializing of production, consumption, and exchange--to belong to federated Communes, or to a hundred other associations for the satisfying of his needs, things would have a different aspect
 A group of shipowners, powerful on sea, would feel weak on land, and they would be obliged to lessen their claims in order to come to terms with railways, factories, and other groups
  At any rate, without discussing the future, here is another spontaneous association that has dispensed with Government
 Let us quote more examples
  As we are talking of ships and boats, let us mention one of the most splendid organizations that the nineteenth century has brought forth, one of those we may with right be proud of--the English Lifeboat Association
  It is known that every year more than a thousand ships are wrecked on the shores of England
 At sea a good ship seldom fears a storm
 It is near the coasts that danger threatens--rough seas that shatter her stern-post, squalls that carry off her masts and sails, currents that render her unmanageable, reefs and sand banks on which she runs aground
  Even in olden times, when it was a custom among inhabitants of the coasts to light fires in order to attract vessels on to reefs, in order to plunder their cargoes, they always strove to save the crew
 Seeing a ship in distress, they launched their boats and went to the rescue of shipwrecked sailors, only too often finding a watery grave themselves
 Every hamlet along the sea shore has its legends of heroism, displayed by woman as well as by man, to save crews in distress
  No doubt the State and men of science have done something to diminish the number of casualties
 Lighthouses, signals, charts, meteorological warnings have diminished them greatly, but there remains a thousand ships and several thousand human lives to be saved every year
  To this end a few men of goodwill put their shoulders to the wheel
 Being good sailors and navigators themselves, they invented a lifeboat that could weather a storm without being torn to pieces or capsizing, and they set to work to interest the public in their venture, to collect the necessary funds for constructing boats, and for stationing them along the coasts, wherever they could be of use
  These men, not being Jacobins, did not turn to the Government
 They understood that to bring their enterprise to a successful issue they must have the co-operation, the enthusiasm, the local knowledge, and especially the self-sacrifice of the local sailors
 They also understood that to find men who at the first signal would launch their boat at night, in a chaos of waves, not suffering themselves to be deterred by darkness or breakers, and struggling five, six, ten hours against the tide before reaching a vessel in distress--men ready to risk their lives to save those of others--there must be a feeling of solidarity, a spirit of sacrifice not to be bought with galloon
 It was therefore a perfectly spontaneous movement, sprung from agreement and individual initiative
 Hundreds of local groups arose along the coasts
 The initiators had the common senses not to pose as masters
 They looked for sagacity in the fishermen's hamlets, and when a rich man sent £1,000 to a village on the coast to erect a lifeboat station, and his offer was accepted, he left the choice of a site to the local fishermen and sailors
  Models of new boats were not submitted to the Admiralty
 We read in a Report of the Association: "As it is of importance that life-boatmen should have full confidence in the vessel they man, the Committee will make a point of constructing and equipping the boats according to the life-boatmen's expressed wish
" In consequence every year brings with it new improvements
  The work is wholly conducted by volunteers organizing in committees and local groups; by mutual aid and agreement!--Oh, Anarchists! Moreover, they ask nothing of the ratepayers, and in a year they may receive £40,000 in spontaneous subscriptions
  As to the results, here they are: In 1891 the Association possessed 293 lifeboats
 The same year it saved 601 shipwrecked sailors and 33 vessels
 Since its foundation it has saved 32,671 human beings
  In 1886, three lifeboats with all their men having perished at sea, hundreds of new volunteers entered their names, organized themselves into local groups, and the agitation resulted in the construction of twenty additional boats
 As we proceed, let us note that every year the Association sends to the fishermen and sailors excellent barometers at a price three times less than their sale price in private shops
 It propagates meteorological knowledge, and warns the parties concerned of the sudden changes of weather predicted by men of science
  Let us repeat that these hundreds of committees and local groups are not organized hierarchically, and are composed exclusively of volunteers, lifeboatmen, and people interested in the work
 The Central Committee, which is more of a centre for correspondence, in no wise interferes
  It is true that when a voting on some question of education or local taxation takes place in a district, these committees of the National Lifeboat Association do not, as such, take part in the deliberations--a modesty, which unfortunately the members of elected bodies do not imitate
 But, on the other hand, these brave men do not allow those who have never faced a storm to legislate for them about saving life
 At the first signal of distress they rush to their boats, and go ahead
 There are no embroidered uniforms, but much goodwill
  Let us take another society of the same kind, that of the Red Cross
 The name matters little; let us examine it
  Imagine somebody saying fifty years ago: "The State, capable as it is of massacring twenty thousand men in a day, and of wounding fifty thousand more, is incapable of helping its own victims; consequently, as long as war exists private initiative must intervene, and men of goodwill must organize internationally for this humane work!" What mockery would not have met the man who would have dared to speak thus! To begin with, he would have been called a Utopian, and if that did not silence him he would have been told: "What nonsense! Your volunteers will be found wanting precisely where they are most needed, your volunteer hospitals will be centralized in a safe place, while everything will be wanting in the ambulances
 Utopians like you forget the national rivalries which will cause the poor soldiers to die without any help
" Such disheartening remarks would have only been equalled by the number of speakers
 Who of us has not heard men hold forth in this strain?  Now we know what happened
 Red Cross societies organized themselves freely, everywhere, in all countries, in thousands of localities; and when the war of 1870-1 broke out, the volunteers set to work
 Men and women offered their services
 Thousands of hospitals and ambulances were organized; trains were started carrying ambulances, provisions, linen, and medicaments for the wounded
 The English committees sent entire convoys of food, clothing, tools, grain to sow, beasts of draught, even steam-ploughs with their attendants to help in the tillage of departments devastated by the war! Only consult _La Croix Rouge_, by Gustave Moynier, and you will be really struck by the immensity of the work performed
  As to the prophets ever ready to deny other men's courage, good sense, and intelligence, and believing themselves to be the only ones capable of ruling the world with a rod, none of their predictions were realized
 The devotion of the Red Cross volunteers was beyond all praise
 They were only too eager to occupy the most dangerous posts; and whereas the salaried doctors of the Napoleonic State fled with their staff when the Prussians approached, the Red Cross volunteers continued their work under fire, enduring the brutalities of Bismarck's and Napoleon's officers, lavishing their care on the wounded of all nationalities
 Dutch, Italians, Swedes, Belgians, even Japanese and Chinese agreed remarkably well
 They distributed their hospitals and their ambulances according to the needs of the occasion
 They vied with one another especially in the hygiene of their hospitals
 And there is many a Frenchman who still speaks with deep gratitude of the tender care he received from the Dutch or German volunteers in the Red Cross ambulances
 But what is this to an authoritarian? His ideal is the regiment doctor, salaried by the State
 What does he care for the Red Cross and its hygienic hospitals, if the nurses be not functionaries!  Here is then an organization, sprung up but yesterday, and which reckons its members by hundreds of thousands; possesses ambulances, hospital trains, elaborates new processes for treating wounds, and so on, and is due to the spontaneous initiative of a few devoted men
  Perhaps we shall be told that the State has something to do with this organization
 Yes, States have laid hands on it to seize it
 The directing committees are presided over by those whom flunkeys call princes of the blood
 Emperors and queens lavishly patronize the national committees
 But it is not to this patronage that the success of the organization is due
 It is to the thousand local committees of each nation; to the activity of individuals, to the devotion of all those who try to help the victims of war
 And this devotion would be far greater if the State did not meddle with it
  In any case, it was not by the order of an International Directing Committee that Englishmen and Japanese, Swedes and Chinamen, bestirred themselves to send help to the wounded in 1871
 It was not by order of an international ministry that hospitals rose on the invaded territory and that ambulances were carried on to the battlefield
 It was by the initiative of volunteers from each country
 Once on the spot, they did not get hold of one another by the hair as was foreseen by the Jacobinists of all nations; they all set to work without distinction of nationality
  We may regret that such great efforts should be put to the service of so bad a cause, and we may ask ourselves like the poet's child: "Why inflict wounds if you are to heal them afterwards?" In striving to destroy the power of capitalist and middle-class authority, we work to put an end to the massacres called wars, and we would far rather see the Red Cross volunteers put forth their activity to bring about (with us) the suppression of war; but we had to mention this immense organization as another illustration of results produced by free agreement and free aid
  If we wished to multiply examples taken from the art of exterminating men we should never end
 Suffice to quote the numerous societies to which the German army owes its force, that does not only depend on discipline, as is generally believed
 I mean the societies whose aim is to propagate military knowledge
  At one of the last congresses of the Military Alliance (Kriegerbund), delegates from 2,452 federated societies, comprising 151,712 members, were present
 But there are besides very numerous Shooting, Military Games, Strategical Games, Topographical Studies Societies--these are the workshops in which the technical knowledge of the German army is developed, not in regimental schools
 It is a formidable network of all kinds of societies, including military men and civilians, geographers and gymnasts, sportsmen and technologists, which rise up spontaneously, organize, federate, discuss, and explore the country
 It is these voluntary and free associations that go to make the real backbone of the German army
  Their aim is execrable
 It is the maintenance of the Empire
 But what concerns us, is to point out that, in spite of military organization being the "Great Mission of the State," success in this branch is the more certain the more it is left to the free agreement of groups and to the free initiative of individuals
  Even in matters pertaining to war, free agreement is thus appealed to; and to further prove our assertion let us mention the Volunteer Topographers' Corps of Switzerland who study in detail the mountain passages, the Aeroplane Corps of France, the three hundred thousand British volunteers, the British National Artillery Association, and the Society, now in course of organization, for the defence of England's coasts, as well as the appeals made to the commercial fleet, the Bicyclists' Corps, and the new organizations of private motorcars and steam launches
  Everywhere the State is abdicating and abandoning its holy functions to private individuals
 Everywhere free organization trespasses on its domain
 And yet, the facts we have quoted give us only a glimpse of what free government has in store for us in the future when there will be no more State
     CHAPTER XII  OBJECTIONS   I  Let us now examine the principal objections put forth against Communism
 Most of them are evidently caused by a simple misunderstanding, yet they raise important questions and merit our attention
  It is not for us to answer the objections raised by authoritarian Communism--we ourselves hold with them
 Civilized nations have suffered too much in the long, hard struggle for the emancipation of the individual, to disown their past work and to tolerate a Government that would make itself felt in the smallest details of a citizen's life, even if that Government had no other aim than the good of the community
 Should an authoritarian Socialist society ever succeed in establishing itself, it could not last; general discontent would soon force it to break up, or to reorganize itself on principles of liberty
  It is of an Anarchist-Communist society we are about to speak, a society that recognizes the absolute liberty of the individual, that does not admit of any authority, and makes use of no compulsion to drive men to work
 Limiting our studies to the economic side of the question, let us see if such a society, composed of men as they are to-day, neither better nor worse, neither more nor less industrious, would have a chance of successful development
  The objection is known
 "If the existence of each is guaranteed, and if the necessity of earning wages does not compel men to work, nobody will work
 Every man will lay the burden of his work on another if he is not forced to do it himself
" Let us first note the incredible levity with which this objection is raised, without even realizing that the real question raised by this objection is merely to know, on the one hand, whether you effectively obtain by wage-work, the results that are said to be obtained, and, on the other hand, whether voluntary work is not already now more productive than work stimulated by wages
 A question which, to be dealt with properly, would require a serious study
 But whereas in exact sciences men give their opinion on subjects infinitely less important and less complicated after serious research, after carefully collecting and analyzing facts--on this question they will pronounce judgment without appeal, resting satisfied with any one particular event, such as, for example, the want of success of some communist association in America
 They act like the barrister who does not see in the counsel for the opposite side a representative of a cause, or an opinion contrary to his own, but a simple nuisance,--an adversary in an oratorical debate; and if he be lucky enough to find a repartee, does not otherwise care to justify his cause
 Therefore the study of this essential basis of all Political Economy, _the study of the most favourable conditions for giving society the greatest amount of useful products with the least waste of human energy_, does not advance
 People either limit themselves to repeating commonplace assertions, or else they pretend ignorance of our assertions
  What is most striking in this levity is that even in capitalist Political Economy you already find a few writers compelled by facts to doubt the axiom put forth by the founders of their science, that the threat of hunger is man's best stimulant for productive work
 They begin to perceive that in production a certain _collective element_ is introduced, which has been too much neglected up till now, and which might be more important than personal gain
 The inferior quality of wage-work, the terrible waste of human energy in modern agricultural and industrial labour, the ever-growing quantity of pleasure-seekers, who shift their burden on to others' shoulders, the absence of a certain animation in production that is becoming more and more apparent; all this is beginning to preoccupy the economists of the "classical" school
 Some of them ask themselves if they have not got on the wrong track: if the imaginary evil being, that was supposed to be tempted exclusively by a bait of lucre or wages, really exists
 This heresy penetrates even into universities; it is found in books of orthodox economy
  But this does not prevent a great many Socialist reformers from remaining partisans of individual remuneration, and defending the old citadel of wagedom, notwithstanding that it is being delivered over stone by stone to the assailants by its former defenders
  They fear that without compulsion the masses will not work
  But during our own lifetime, have we not heard the same fears expressed twice? Once, by the anti-abolitionists in America before the emancipation of the Negroes, and, for a second time, by the Russian nobility before the liberation of the serfs? "Without the whip the Negro will not work," said the anti-abolitionist
 "Free from their master's supervision the serfs will leave the fields uncultivated," said the Russian serf-owners
 It was the refrain of the French noblemen in 1789, the refrain of the Middle Ages, a refrain as old as the world, and we shall hear it every time there is a question of sweeping away an injustice
 And each time actual facts give it the lie
 The liberated peasant of 1792 ploughed with an eager energy, unknown to his ancestors; the emancipated Negro works more than his fathers; and the Russian peasant, after having honoured the honeymoon of his emancipation by celebrating Fridays as well as Sundays, has taken up work with an eagerness proportionate to the completeness of his liberation
 There, where the soil is his, he works desperately; that is the exact word for it
 The anti-abolitionist refrain can be of value to slave-owners; as to the slaves themselves, they know what it is worth, as they know its motive
  Moreover, who but the economists themselves taught us that while a wage-earner's work is very often indifferent, an intense and productive work is only obtained from a man who sees his wealth increase in proportion to his efforts? All hymns sung in honour of private property can be reduced to this axiom
  For it is remarkable that when economists, wishing to celebrate the blessings of property, show us how an unproductive, marshy, or stony soil is clothed with rich harvests when cultivated by the peasant proprietor, they in nowise prove their thesis in favour of private property
 By admitting that the only guarantee not to be robbed of the fruits of your labour is to possess the instruments of labour--which is true--the economists only prove that man really produces most when he works in freedom, when he has a certain choice in his occupations, when he has no overseer to impede him, and lastly, when he sees his work bringing in a profit to him and to others who work like him, but bringing in little to idlers
 Nothing else can be deducted from their argumentation, and this is what we maintain ourselves
  As to the form of possession of the instruments of labour, the economists only mention it _indirectly_ in their demonstration, as a guarantee to the cultivator that he shall not be robbed of the profits of his yield nor of his improvements
 Besides, in support of their thesis in favour of _private property_ against all other forms of _possession_, should not the economists demonstrate that under the form of communal property land never produces such rich harvests as when the possession is private? But this they could not prove; in fact, it is the contrary that has been observed
  Take for example a commune in the canton of Vaud, in the winter time, when all the men of the village go to fell wood in the forest, which belongs to them all
 It is precisely during these festivals of labour that the greatest ardour for work and the most considerable display of human energy are apparent
 No salaried labour, no effort of a private owner can bear comparison with it
  Or let us take a Russian village, when all its inhabitants mow a field belonging to the commune, or farmed by it
 There you will see what man _can_ produce when he works in common for communal production
 Comrades vie with one another in cutting the widest swathe, women bestir themselves in their wake so as not to be distanced by the mowers
 It is a festival of labour, in which a hundred people accomplish in a few hours a work that would not have been finished in a few days had they worked separately
 What a miserable contrast compared to them is offered by the work of the isolated owner!  In fact, we might quote scores of examples among the pioneers of America, in Swiss, German, Russian, and in certain French villages; or the work done in Russia by gangs (_artels)_ of masons, carpenters, boatmen, fishermen, etc
, who undertake a task and divide the produce or the remuneration among themselves without it passing through an intermediary of middlemen; or else the amount of work I saw performed in English ship-yards when the remuneration was paid on the same principle
 We could also mention the great communal hunts of nomadic tribes, and an infinite number of successful collective enterprises
 And in every case we could show the unquestionable superiority of communal work compared to that of the wage-earner or the isolated private owner
  Well-being--that is to say, the satisfaction of physical, artistic, and moral needs, has always been the most powerful stimulant to work
 And where a hireling hardly succeeds to produce the bare necessities with difficulty, a free worker, who sees ease and luxury increasing for him and for others in proportion to his efforts, spends infinitely far more energy and intelligence, and obtains products in a far greater abundance
 The one feels riveted to misery, the other hopes for ease and luxury in the future
 In this lies the whole secret
 Therefore a society aiming at the well-being of all, and at the possibility of all enjoying life in all its manifestations, will give voluntary work, which will be infinitely superior and yield far more than work has produced up till now under the goad of slavery, serfdom, or wagedom
   II  Nowadays, whoever can load on others his share of labour indispensable to existence does so, and it is believed that it will always be so
  Now, work indispensable to existence is essentially manual
 We may be artists or scientists; but none of us can do without things obtained by manual work--bread, clothes, roads, ships, light, heat, etc
 And, moreover, however highly artistic or however subtly metaphysical are our pleasures, they all depend on manual labour
 And it is precisely this labour--the basis of life--that everyone tries to avoid
  We understand perfectly well that it must be so nowadays
  Because, to do manual work now, means in reality to shut yourself up for ten or twelve hours a day in an unhealthy workshop, and to remain chained to the same task for twenty or thirty years, and maybe for your whole life
  It means to be doomed to a paltry wage, to the uncertainty of the morrow, to want of work, often to destitution, more often than not to death in a hospital, after having worked forty years to feed, clothe, amuse, and instruct others than yourself and your children
  It means to bear the stamp of inferiority all your life; because, whatever the politicians tell us, the manual worker is always considered inferior to the brain worker, and the one who has toiled ten hours in a workshop has not the time, and still less the means, to give himself the high delights of science and art, nor even to prepare himself to appreciate them; he must be content with the crumbs from the table of privileged persons
  We understand that under these conditions manual labour is considered a curse of fate
  We understand that all men have but one dream--that of emerging from, or enabling their children to emerge from this inferior state; to create for themselves an "independent" position, which means what?--To also live by other men's work!  As long as there will be a class of manual workers and a class of "brain" workers, black hands and white hands, it will be thus
  What interest, in fact, can this depressing work have for the worker, when he knows that the fate awaiting him from the cradle to the grave will be to live in mediocrity, poverty, and insecurity of the morrow? Therefore, when we see the immense majority of men take up their wretched task every morning, we feel surprised at their perseverance, at their zeal for work, at the habit that enables them, like machines blindly obeying an impetus given, to lead this life of misery without hope for the morrow; without foreseeing ever so vaguely that some day they, or at least their children, will be part of a humanity rich in all the treasures of a bountiful nature, in all the enjoyments of knowledge, scientific and artistic creation, reserved to-day to a few privileged favourites
  It is precisely to put an end to this separation between manual and brain work that we want to abolish wagedom, that we want the Social Revolution
 Then work will no longer appear a curse of fate: it will become what it should be--the free exercise of _all_ the faculties of man
  Moreover, it is time to submit to a serious analysis this legend about superior work, supposed to be obtained under the lash of wagedom
  It would be sufficient to visit, not the model factory and workshop that we find now and again, but a number of the ordinary factories, to conceive the immense waste of human energy that characterizes modern industry
 For one factory more or less rationally organized, there are a hundred or more which waste man's labour, without any more substantial motive than that of perhaps bringing in a few pounds more per day to the employer
  Here you see youths from twenty to twenty-five years of age, sitting all day long on a bench, their chests sunken in, feverishly shaking their heads and bodies, to tie, with the speed of conjurers, the two ends of worthless scraps of cotton, the refuse of the lace-looms
 What progeny will these trembling and rickety bodies bequeath to their country? "But they occupy so little room in the factory, and each of them brings me in sixpence net every day," will say the employer
  In an immense London factory we saw girls, bald at seventeen from carrying trays of matches on their heads from one room to another, when the simplest machine could wheel the matches to their tables
 But "It costs so little, the work of women who have no special trade! Why should we use a machine? When these can do no more, they will be easily replaced, there are so many of them in the street!"  On the steps of a mansion on an icy night you will find a bare-footed child asleep, with its bundle of papers in its arms 


 child-labour costs so little that it may be well employed, every evening, to sell tenpenny-worth of papers, of which the poor boy will receive a penny, or a penny halfpenny
 And continually in all big cities you may see robust men tramping about who have been out of work for months, while their daughters grow pale in the overheated vapours of the workshops for dressing stuffs, and their sons are filling blacking-pots by hand, or spend those years during which they ought to have learned a trade, in carrying about baskets for a greengrocer, and at the age of eighteen or twenty become regular unemployed
  And so it is everywhere, from San Francisco to Moscow, and from Naples to Stockholm
 The waste of human energy is the distinguishing and predominant trait of our industry, not to mention trade where it attains still more colossal proportions
  What a sad satire is that name, Political _Economy_, given to the science of waste and energy under the system of wagedom!  This is not all
 If you speak to the director of a well-organized factory, he will naively explain to you that it is difficult nowadays to find a skilful, vigorous, and energetic workman, who works with a will
 "Should such a man present himself among the twenty or thirty who call every Monday asking us for work, he is sure to be received, even if we are reducing the number of our hands
 We recognize him at the first glance, and he is always accepted, even though we have to get rid of an older and less active worker the next day
" And the one who has just received notice to quit, and all those who will receive it to-morrow, go to reinforce that immense reserve-army of capital--workmen out of work--who are only called to the loom or the bench when there is pressure of work, or to oppose strikers
 And those others--the average workers who are sent away by the better-class factories as soon as business is slackened? They also join the formidable army of aged and indifferent workers who continually circulate among the second-class factories--those which barely cover their expenses and make their way in the world by trickery and snares laid for the buyer, and especially for the consumer in distant countries
  And if you talk to the workmen themselves, you will soon learn that the rule in such factories is--never to do your best
 "Shoddy pay--shoddy work!" this is the advice which the working man receives from his comrades upon entering such a factory
  For the workers know that if in a moment of generosity they give way to the entreaties of an employer and consent to intensify the work in order to carry out a pressing order, this nervous work will be exacted in the future as a rule in the scale of wages
 Therefore in all such factories they prefer never to produce as much as they can
 In certain industries production is limited so as to keep up high prices, and sometimes the pass-word, "Go-canny," is given, which signifies, "Bad work for bad pay!"  Wage-work is serf-work; it cannot, it must not, produce all that it could produce
 And it is high time to disbelieve the legend which represents wagedom as the best incentive to productive work
 If industry nowadays brings in a hundred times more than it did in the days of our grandfathers, it is due to the sudden awakening of physical and chemical sciences towards the end of last century; not to the capitalist organization of wagedom, but _in spite_ of that organization
   III  Those who have seriously studied the question do not deny any of the advantages of Communism, on condition, be it well understood, that Communism be perfectly free, that is to say, Anarchist
 They recognize that work paid with money, even disguised under the name of "labour cheques," to Workers' associations governed by the State, would keep up the characteristics of wagedom and would retain its disadvantages
 They agree that the whole system would soon suffer from it, even if Society came into possession of the instruments of production
 And they admit that, thanks to an "integral" complete education given to all children, to the laborious habits of civilized societies, with the liberty of choosing and varying their occupations and the attractions of work done by equals for the well-being of all, a Communist society would not be wanting in producers who would soon make the fertility of the soil triple and tenfold, and give a new impulse to industry
  This our opponents agree to
 "But the danger," they say, "will come from that minority of loafers who will not work, and will not have regular habits, in spite of the excellent conditions that would make work pleasant
 To-day the prospect of hunger compels the most refractory to move along with the others
 The one who does not arrive in time is dismissed
 But one black sheep suffices to contaminate the whole flock, and two or three sluggish or refractory workmen would lead the others astray and bring a spirit of disorder and rebellion into the workshop that would make work impossible; so that in the end we should have to return to a system of compulsion that would force such ringleaders back into the ranks
 And then,--Is not the system of wages, paid in proportion to work performed, the only one that enables compulsion to be employed, without hurting the feelings of independence of the worker? All other means would imply the continual intervention of an authority that would be repugnant to free men
" This, we believe, is the objection fairly stated
  To begin with, such an objection belongs to the category of arguments which try to justify the State, the Penal Law, the Judge, and the Gaoler
  "As there are people, a feeble minority, who will not submit to social customs," the authoritarians say, "we must maintain magistrates, tribunals and prisons, although these institutions become a source of new evils of all kinds
"  Therefore we can only repeat what we have so often said concerning authority in general: "To avoid a possible evil you have recourse to means which in themselves are a greater evil, and become the source of those same abuses that you wish to remedy
 For, do not forget that it is wagedom, the impossibility of living otherwise than by selling your labour, which has created the present Capitalist system, whose vices you begin to recognize
" Besides, this way of reasoning is merely a sophistical justification of the evils of the present system
 Wagedom was _not_ instituted to remove the disadvantages of Communism; its origin, like that of the State and private ownership, is to be found elsewhere
 It is born of slavery and serfdom imposed by force, and only wears a more modern garb
 Thus the argument in favour of wagedom is as valueless as those by which they seek to apologize for private property and the State
  We are, nevertheless, going to examine the objection, and see if there is any truth in it
  First of all,--Is it not evident that if a society, founded on the principle of free work, were really menaced by loafers, it could protect itself without the authoritarian organization we have nowadays, and without having recourse to wagedom?  Let us take a group of volunteers, combining for some particular enterprise
 Having its success at heart, they all work with a will, save one of the associates, who is frequently absent from his post
 Must they on his account dissolve the group, elect a president to impose fines, and work out a code of penalties? It is evident that neither the one nor the other will be done, but that some day the comrade who imperils their enterprise will be told: "Friend, we should like to work with you; but as you are often absent from your post, and you do your work negligently, we must part
 Go and find other comrades who will put up with your indifference!"  This way is so natural that it is practiced everywhere, even nowadays, in all industries, in competition with all possible systems of fines, docking of wages, supervision, etc
; a workman may enter the factory at the appointed time, but if he does his work badly, if he hinders his comrades by his laziness or other defects, if he is quarrelsome, there is an end of it; he is compelled to leave the workshop
  Authoritarians pretend that it is the almighty employer and his overseers who maintain regularity and quality of work in factories
 In reality, in every somewhat complicated enterprise, in which the goods produced pass through many hands before being finished, it is the factory itself, the workmen as a unity, who see to the good quality of the work
 Therefore the best factories of British private industry have few overseers, far less on an average than the French factories, and less than the British State factories
  A certain standard of public morals is maintained in the same way
 Authoritarians say it is due to rural guards, judges, and policemen, whereas in reality it is maintained _in spite_ of judges, policemen, and rural guards
 "Many are the laws producing criminals!" was said long ago
  Not only in industrial workshops do things go on in this way; it happens everywhere, every day, on a scale that only bookworms have as yet no notion of
 When a railway company, federated with other companies, fails to fulfil its engagements, when its trains are late and goods lie neglected at the stations, the other companies threaten to cancel the contract, and that threat usually suffices
  It is generally believed, at any rate it is taught in State-approved schools, that commerce only keeps to its engagements from fear of lawsuits
 Nothing of the sort; nine times in ten the trader who has not kept his word will not appear before a judge
 There, where trade is very active, as in London, the sole fact of having driven a creditor to bring a lawsuit suffices for the immense majority of merchants to refuse for good to have any dealings with a man who has compelled one of them to go to law
  This being so, why should means that are used to-day among workers in the workshop, traders in the trade, and railway companies in the organization of transport, not be made use of in a society based on voluntary work?  Take, for example, an association stipulating that each of its members should carry out the following contract: "We undertake to give you the use of our houses, stores, streets, means of transport, schools, museums, etc
, on condition that, from twenty to forty-five or fifty years of age, you consecrate four or five hours a day to some work recognized as necessary to existence
 Choose yourself the producing groups which you wish to join, or organize a new group, provided that it will undertake to produce necessaries
 And as for the remainder of your time, combine together with whomsoever you like, for recreation, art, or science, according to the bent of your taste
  "Twelve or fifteen hundred hours of work a year, in one of the groups producing food, clothes, or houses, or employed in public sanitation, transport, and so on, is all we ask of you
 For this amount of work we guarantee to you the free use of all that these groups produce, or will produce
 But if not one, of the thousands of groups of our federation, will receive you, whatever be their motive; if you are absolutely incapable of producing anything useful, or if you refuse to do it, then live like an isolated man or like an invalid
 If we are rich enough to give you the necessaries of life we shall be delighted to give them to you
 You are a man, and you have the right to live
 But as you wish to live under special conditions, and leave the ranks, it is more than probable that you will suffer for it in your daily relations with other citizens
 You will be looked upon as a ghost of bourgeois society, unless some friends of yours, discovering you to be a talent, kindly free you from all moral obligation towards society by doing all the necessary work for you
  "And finally, if it does not please you, go and look for other conditions elsewhere in the wide world, or else seek adherents and organize with them on novel principles
 We prefer our own
"  This is what could be done in a communal society in order to turn away sluggards if they became too numerous
   IV  We very much doubt that we need fear this contingency in a society really based on the entire freedom of the individual
  In fact, in spite of the premium on idleness offered by the private ownership of capital, the really lazy man is comparatively rare, unless his laziness be due to illness
  Among workmen it is often said that the bourgeois are idlers
 There are certainly enough of them, but they, too, are the exception
 On the contrary, in every industrial enterprise, you are sure to find one or more bourgeois who work very hard
 It is true that the majority of bourgeois profit by their privileged position to award themselves the least unpleasant tasks, and that they work under hygienic conditions of air, food, etc
, which permits them to do their business without too much fatigue
 But these are precisely the conditions which we claim for all workers, without exception
  It must also be said that if, thanks to their privileged position, rich people often perform absolutely useless or even harmful work in society, nevertheless the Ministers, Heads of Departments, factory owners, traders, bankers, etc
, subject themselves for a number of hours every day to work which they find more or less tiresome, all preferring their hours of leisure to this obligatory work
 And if in nine cases out of ten this work is a harmful work, they find it none the less tiring for that
 But it is precisely because the middle class put forth a great energy, even in doing harm (knowingly or not) and defending their privileged position, that they have succeeded in defeating the landed nobility, and that they continue to rule the masses
 If they were idlers, they would long since have ceased to exist, and would have disappeared like the aristocracy
 In a society that would expect only four or five hours a day of useful, pleasant, and hygienic work, these same middle-class people would perform their task perfectly well, and they certainly would not put up with the horrible conditions in which men toil nowadays without reforming them
 If a Huxley spent only five hours in the sewers of London, rest assured that he would have found the means of making them as sanitary as his physiological laboratory
  As to the laziness of the great majority of workers, only philistine economists and philanthropists can utter such nonsense
  If you ask an intelligent manufacturer, he will tell you that if workmen only put it into their heads to be lazy, all factories would have to be closed, for no measure of severity, no system of spying would be of any use
 You should have seen the terror caused in 1887 among British employers when a few agitators started preaching the "_go-canny_" theory--"Bad pay, bad work"; "Take it easy, do not overwork yourselves, and waste all you can
"--"They demoralize the worker, they want to kill our industry!" cried those same people who the day before inveighed against the immorality of the worker and the bad quality of his work
 But if the workers were what they are represented to be--namely, the idler whom the employer is supposed continually to threaten with dismissal from the workshop--what would the word "demoralization" signify?  So when we speak of possible idlers, we must well understand that it is a question of a small minority in society; and before legislating for that minority, would it not be wise to study the origin of that idleness? Whoever observes with an intelligent eye, sees well enough that the child reputed lazy at school is often the one which simply does not understand, because he is being badly taught
 Very often, too, it is suffering from cerebral anæmia, caused by poverty and an anti-hygienic education
 A boy who is lazy at Greek or Latin would work admirably were he taught science, especially if he were taught with the aid of manual labour
 A girl who is stupid at mathematics becomes the first mathematician of her class if she by chance meets somebody who can explain to her the elements of arithmetic which she did not understand
 And a workman, lazy in the workshop, cultivates his garden at dawn, while gazing at the rising sun, and will be at work again at nightfall, when all nature goes to its rest
  Somebody has said that dust is matter in the wrong place
 The same definition applies to nine-tenths of those called lazy
 They are people gone astray in a direction that does not answer to their temperament nor to their capacities
 In reading the biography of great men, we are struck with the number of "idlers" among them
 They were lazy so long as they had not found the right path; afterwards they became laborious to excess
 Darwin, Stephenson, and many others belonged to this category of idlers
  Very often the idler is but a man to whom it is repugnant to spend all his life making the eighteenth part of a pin, or the hundredth part of a watch, while he feels he has exuberant energy which he would like to expend elsewhere
 Often, too, he is a rebel who cannot submit to being fixed all his life to a work-bench in order to procure a thousand pleasures for his employer, while knowing himself to be far the less stupid of the two, and knowing his only fault to be that of having been born in a hovel instead of coming into the world in a castle
  Lastly, an immense number of "idlers" are idlers because they do not know well enough the trade by which they are compelled to earn their living
 Seeing the imperfect thing they make with their own hands, striving vainly to do better, and perceiving that they never will succeed on account of the bad habits of work already acquired, they begin to hate their trade, and, not knowing any other, hate work in general
 Thousands of workmen and artists who are failures suffer from this cause
  On the other hand, he who since his youth has learned to play the piano _well_, to handle the plane _well_, the chisel, the brush, or the file, so that he feels that what he does is _beautiful_, will never give up the piano, the chisel, or the file
 He will find pleasure in his work which does not tire him, so long as he is not overdriven
  Under the one name, _idleness_, a series of results due to different causes have been grouped, of which each one could be a source of good, instead of being a source of evil to society
 Like all questions concerning criminality and related to human faculties, facts have been collected having nothing in common with one another
 People speak of laziness or crime, without giving themselves the trouble to analyze the cause
 They are in a hurry to punish these faults without inquiring if the punishment itself does not contain a premium on "laziness" or "crime
"[9]  This is why a free society, if it saw the number of idlers increasing in its midst, would no doubt think of looking first for the _cause_ of laziness, in order to suppress it, before having recourse to punishment
 When it is a case, as we have already mentioned, of simple bloodlessness, then before stuffing the brain of a child with science, nourish his system so as to produce blood, strengthen him, and, that he shall not waste his time, take him to the country or to the seaside; there, teach him in the open air, not in books--geometry, by measuring the distance to a spire, or the height of a tree; natural sciences, while picking flowers and fishing in the sea; physical science, while building the boat he will go to fish in
 But for mercy's sake do not fill his brain with classical sentences and dead languages
 Do not make an idler of him!


  Or, here is a child which has neither order nor regular habits
 Let the children first inculcate order among themselves, and later on, the laboratory, the workshop, the work that will have to be done in a limited space, with many tools about, under the guidance of an intelligent teacher, will teach them method
 But do not make disorderly beings out of them by your school, whose only order is the symmetry of its benches, and which--true image of the chaos in its teachings--will never inspire anybody with the love of harmony, of consistency, and method in work
  Do not you see that by your methods of teaching, framed by a Ministry for eight million scholars, who represent eight million different capacities, you only impose a system good for mediocrities, conceived by an average of mediocrities? Your school becomes a University of laziness, as your prison is a University of crime
 Make the school free, abolish your University grades, appeal to the volunteers of teaching; begin that way, instead of making laws against laziness which only serve to increase it
  Give the workman who cannot condemn himself to make all his life a minute particle of some object, who is stifled at his little tapping machine, which he ends by loathing, give him the chance of tilling the soil, of felling trees in the forest, sailing the seas in the teeth of a storm, dashing through space on an engine, but do not make an idler of him by forcing him all his life to attend to a small machine, to plough the head of a screw, or to drill the eye of a needle
  Suppress the cause of idleness, and you may take it for granted that few individuals will really hate work, especially voluntary work, and that there will be no need to manufacture a code of laws on their account

     CHAPTER XIII  THE COLLECTIVIST WAGES SYSTEM   I  In their plans for the reconstruction of society the collectivists commit, in our opinion, a twofold error
 While speaking of abolishing capitalist rule, they intend nevertheless to retain two institutions which are the very basis of this rule--Representative Government and the Wages' System
  As regards so-called representative government, we have often spoken about it
 It is absolutely incomprehensible to us that intelligent men--and such are not wanting in the collectivist party--can remain partisans of national or municipal parliaments after all the lessons history has given them--in France, in England, in Germany, or in the United States
  While we see parliamentary rule breaking up, and from all sides criticism of this rule growing louder--not only of its results, but also of _its principles_--how is it that the revolutionary socialists defend a system already condemned to die?  Built up by the middle classes to hold their own against royalty, sanctioning, and, at the same time strengthening, their sway over the workers, parliamentary rule is pre-eminently a middle-class rule
 The upholders of this system have never seriously maintained that a parliament or a municipal council represent a nation or a city
 The most intelligent among them know that this is impossible
 The middle classes have simply used the parliamentary system to raise a protecting barrier against the pretensions of royalty, without giving the people liberty
 But gradually, as the people become conscious of their real interests, and the variety of their interests is growing, the system can no longer work
 Therefore democrats of all countries vainly imagine various palliatives
 The _Referendum_ is tried and found to be a failure; proportional representation is spoken of, the representation of minorities, and other parliamentary Utopias
 In a word, they strive to find what is not to be found, and after each new experiment they are bound to recognize that it was a failure; so that confidence in Representative Government vanishes more and more
  It is the same with the Wages' system; because, once the abolition of private property is proclaimed, and the possession in common of all means of production is introduced,--how can the wages' system be maintained in any form? This is, nevertheless, what collectivists are doing when they recommend the use of the _labour-cheques_ as a mode of remuneration for labour accomplished for the great Collectivist employer--the State
  It is easy to understand why the early English socialists, since the time of Robert Owen, came to the system of labour-cheques
 They simply tried to make Capital and Labour agree
 They repudiated the idea of laying hands on capitalist property by means of revolutionary measures
  It is also easy to understand why Proudhon took up later on the same idea
 In his Mutualist system he tried to make Capital less offensive, notwithstanding the retaining of private property, which he detested from the bottom of his heart, but which he believed to be necessary to guarantee individuals against the State
  Neither is it astonishing that certain economists, more or less bourgeois, admit labour-cheques
 They care little whether the worker is paid in labour-notes or in coin stamped with the effigy of the Republic or the Empire
 They only care to save from destruction the individual ownership of dwelling-houses, of land, of factories; in any case--that, at least, of dwelling-houses and the capital that is necessary for manufacturing
 And labour-notes would just answer the purpose of upholding this private property
  As long as labour-notes can be exchanged for jewels or carriages, the owner of the house will willingly accept them for rent
 And as long as dwelling houses, fields, and factories belong to isolated owners, men will have to pay these owners, in one way or another, for being allowed to work in the fields or factories, or for living in the houses
 The owners will agree to be paid by the workers in gold, in paper-money, or in cheques exchangeable for all sorts of commodities, once that toll upon labour is maintained, and the right to levy it is left with them
 But how can we defend labour-notes, this new form of wagedom, when we admit that the houses, the fields, and the factories will no longer be private property,--that they will belong to the commune or the nation?   II  Let us closely examine this system of remuneration for work done, preached by the French, German, English, and Italian collectivists (the Spanish anarchists, who still call themselves collectivists, imply by Collectivism the possession in common of all instruments of production, and the "liberty of each group to divide the produce, as they think fit, according to communist or any other principles")
  It amounts to this: Everybody works in field, factory, school, hospital, etc
 The working-day is fixed by the State, which owns the land, the factories, the roads, etc
 Every work-day is paid for with a _labour-note_, which is inscribed with these words: _Eight hours' work_
 With this cheque the worker can procure all sorts of merchandise in the stores owned by the State or by divers corporations
 The cheque is divisible, so that you can buy an hour's-work worth of meat, ten minutes' worth of matches, or half an hour of tobacco
 After the Collectivist Revolution, instead of saying "twopence worth of soap," we shall say "five minutes' worth of soap
"  Most collectivists, true to the distinction laid down by middle-class economists (and by Marx as well) between _qualified_ work and _simple_ work, tell us, moreover, that _qualified_ or professional work must be paid a certain quantity more than _simple_ work
 Thus one hour's work of a doctor will have to be considered as equivalent to two or three hours' work of a hospital nurse, or to three or five hours' work of a navvy
 "Professional, or qualified work, will be a multiple of simple work," says the collectivist Grönlund, "because this kind of work needs a more or less long apprenticeship
"  Some other collectivists, such as the French Marxist, Guesde, do not make this distinction
 They proclaim the "Equality of Wages
" The doctor, the schoolmaster, and the professor will be paid (in labour-cheques) at the same rate as the navvy
 Eight hours visiting the sick in a hospital will be worth the same as eight hours spent in earthworks or else in mines or factories
  Some make a greater concession; they admit that disagreeable or unhealthy work--such as sewerage--could be paid for at a higher rate than agreeable work
 One hour's work of a sewerman would be worth, they say, two hours of a professor's work
  Let us add that certain collectivists admit of corporations being paid a lump sum for work done
 Thus a corporation would say: "Here are a hundred tons of steel
 A hundred workmen were required to produce them, and it took them ten days
 Their work-day being an eight-hours day, it has taken them eight thousand working hours to produce a hundred tons of steel--eight hours a ton
" For this the State would pay them eight thousand labour-notes of one hour each, and these eight thousand cheques would be divided among the members of the iron-works as they themselves thought proper
  On the other hand, a hundred miners having taken twenty days to extract eight thousand tons of coal, coal would be worth two hours a ton, and the sixteen thousand cheques of one hour each, received by the Guild of Miners, would be divided among their members according to their own appreciation
  If the miners protested and said that a ton of steel should only cost six hours' work instead of eight; if the professor wished to have his day paid four times more than the nurse, then the State would interfere and would settle their differences
  Such is, in a few words, the organization the collectivists wish to see arise out of the Social Revolution
 As we see, their principles are: Collective property of the instruments of production, and remuneration to each according to the time spent in producing, while taking into account the productivity of his labour
 As to the political system, it would be the Parliamentary system, modified by _positive instructions_ given to those elected, and by the _Referendum_--a vote, taken by _noes_ or _ayes_ by the nation
  Let us own that this system appears to us simply unrealizable
  Collectivists begin by proclaiming a revolutionary principle--the abolition of private property--and then they deny it, no sooner than proclaimed, by upholding an organization of production and consumption which originated in private property
  They proclaim a revolutionary principle, and ignore the consequences that this principle will inevitably bring about
 They forget that the very fact of abolishing individual property in the instruments of work--land, factories, road, capital--must launch society into absolutely new channels; must completely overthrow the present system of production, both in its aim as well as in its means; must modify daily relations between individuals, as soon as land, machinery, and all other instruments of production are considered common property
  They say, "No private property," and immediately after strive to maintain private property in its daily manifestations
 "You shall be a Commune as far as regards production: fields, tools, machinery, all that has been invented up till now--factories, railways, harbours, mines, etc
, all are yours
 Not the slightest distinction will be made concerning the share of each in this collective property
  "But from to-morrow you will minutely debate the share you are going to take in the creation of new machinery, in the digging of new mines
 You will carefully weigh what part of the new produce belongs to you
 You will count your minutes of work, and you will take care that a minute of your neighbours should not buy more than yours
  "And as an hour measures nothing, as in some factories a worker can see to six power-looms at a time, while in another he only tends two, you will weigh the muscular force, the brain energy, and the nervous energy you have expended
 You will accurately calculate the years of apprenticeship in order to appraise the amount each will contribute to future production
 And this--after having declared that you do not take into account his share in _past_ production
"  Well, for us it is evident that a society cannot be based on two absolutely opposed principles, two principles that contradict one another continually
 And a nation or a commune which would have such an organization would be compelled to revert to private property in the instruments of production, or to transform itself into a communist society
   III  We have said that certain collectivist writers desire that a distinction should be made between _qualified_ or professional work and _simple_ work
 They pretend that an hour's work of an engineer, an architect, or a doctor, must be considered as two or three hours' work of a blacksmith, a mason, or a hospital nurse
 And the same distinction must be made between all sorts of trades necessitating apprenticeship, and the simple toil of day labourers
  Well, to establish this distinction would be to maintain all the inequalities of present society
 It would mean fixing a dividing line, from the beginning, between the workers and those who pretend to govern them
 It would mean dividing society into two very distinct classes--the aristocracy of knowledge placed above the horny-handed lower orders--the one doomed to serve the other; the one working with its hands to feed and clothe those who, profiting by their leisure, study how to govern their fosterers
  It would mean reviving one of the distinct peculiarities of present society and giving it the sanction of the Social Revolution
 It would mean setting up as a principle an abuse already condemned in our ancient crumbling society
  We know the answer we shall get
 They will speak of "Scientific Socialism"; they will quote bourgeois economists, and Marx too, to prove that a scale of wages has its _raison d'être_, as "the labour force" of the engineer will have cost more to society than the "labour-force" of the navvy
 In fact--have not economists tried to prove to us that if an engineer is paid twenty times more than a navvy it is _because_ the "necessary" outlay to make an engineer is greater than that necessary to make a navvy? And has not Marx asserted that the same distinction is equally logical between two branches of manual labour? He could not conclude otherwise, having taken up on his own account Ricardo's theory of value, and upheld that goods _are_ exchanged in proportion to the quantity of work socially necessary for their production
  But we know what to think of this
 We know that if engineers, scientists, or doctors are paid ten or a hundred times more than a labourer, and if a weaver earns three times more than an agricultural labourer, and ten times more than a girl in a match factory, it is not by reason of their "cost of production," but by reason of a monopoly of education, or a monopoly of industry
 Engineers, scientists, and doctors merely exploit their capital--their diplomas--as middle-class employers exploit a factory, or as nobles used to exploit their titles of nobility
  As to the employer who pays an engineer twenty times more than a labourer, it is simply due to personal interest; if the engineer can economize £4,000 a year on the cost of production, the employer pays him £800
 And if the employer has a foreman who saves £400 on the work by cleverly sweating workmen, he gladly gives him £80 or £120 a year
 He parts with an extra £40 when he expects to gain £400 by it; and this is the essence of the Capitalist system
 The same differences obtain among different manual trades
  Let them, therefore, not talk to us of "the cost of production" which raises the cost of skilled labour, and tell us that a student who has gaily spent his youth in a university has a _right_ to a wage ten times greater than the son of a miner who has grown pale in a mine since the age of eleven; or that a weaver has a _right_ to a wage three or four times greater than that of an agricultural labourer
 The cost of teaching a weaver his work is not four times greater than the cost of teaching a peasant his
 The weaver simply benefits by the advantages his industry reaps in international trade, from countries that have as yet no industries, and in consequence of the privileges accorded by all States to industries in preference to the tilling of the soil
  Nobody has ever calculated the _cost of production_ of a producer; and if a noble loafer costs far more to society than a worker, it remains to be seen whether a robust day-labourer does not cost more to society than a skilled artisan, when we have taken into account infant-mortality among the poor, the ravages of anæmia, and premature deaths
  Could they, for example, make us believe that the 1s
 3d
 paid to a Paris workwoman, the 3d
 paid to an Auvergne peasant girl who grows blind at lace-making, or the 1s
 8d
 paid to the peasant represent their "cost of production
" We know full well that people work for less, but we also know that they do so exclusively because, thanks to our wonderful organization, they would die of hunger did they not accept these mock wages
  For us the scale of remuneration is a complex result of taxes, of governmental tutelage, of Capitalist monopoly
 In a word, of State and Capital
 Therefore, we say that all wages' theories have been invented after the event to justify injustices at present existing, and that we need not take them into consideration
  Neither will they fail to tell us that the Collectivist scale of wages would be an improvement
 "It would be better," so they say, "to see certain artisans receiving a wage two or three times higher than common labourers, than to see a minister receiving in a day what a workman cannot earn in a year
 It would be a great step towards equality
"  For us this step would be the reverse of progress
 To make a distinction between simple and professional work in a new society would result in the Revolution sanctioning and recognizing as a principle a brutal fact we submit to nowadays, but that we nevertheless find unjust
 It would mean imitating those gentlemen of the French Assembly who proclaimed on August 4th, 1789, the abolition of feudal rights, but who on August 8th sanctioned these same rights by imposing dues on the peasants to compensate the noblemen, placing these dues under the protection of the Revolution
 It would mean imitating the Russian Government, which proclaimed, at the time of the emancipation of the serfs, that certain lands should henceforth belong to the nobility, while formerly these lands were considered as belonging to the serfs
  Or else, to take a better known example, when the Commune of 1871 decided to pay members of the Commune Council 12s
 6d
 a day, while the Federates on the ramparts received only 1s
 3d
, this decision was hailed as an act of superior democratic equality
 In reality, the Commune only ratified the former inequality between functionary and soldier, Government and governed
 Coming from an Opportunist Chamber of Deputies, such a decision would have appeared admirable, but the Commune doomed her own revolutionary principles when she failed to put them into practice
  Under our existing social system, when a minister gets paid £4,000 a year, while a workman must content himself with £40 or less; when a foreman is paid two or three times more than a workman, and among workmen there is every gradation, from 8s
 a day down to the peasant girl's 3d
, we disapprove of the high salary of the minister as well as of the difference between the 8s
 of the workman and the 3d
 of the poor woman
 And we say, '"Down with the privileges of education, as well as with those of birth!" We are anarchists precisely because these privileges revolt us
  They revolt us already in this authoritarian society
 Could we endure them in a society that began by proclaiming equality?  This is why some collectivists, understanding the impossibility of maintaining a scale of wages in a society inspired by the breath of the Revolution, hasten to proclaim equality of wage
 But they meet with new difficulties, and their equality of wages becomes the same unrealizable Utopia as the scale of wages of other collectivists
  A society having taken possession of all social wealth, having boldly proclaimed the right of all to this wealth--whatever share they may have taken in producing it--will be compelled to abandon any system of wages, whether in currency or labour-notes
   IV  The collectivists say, "To each according to his deeds"; or, in other terms, according to his share of services rendered to society
 They think it expedient to put this principle into practice, as soon as the Social Revolution will have made all instruments of production common property
 But we think that if the Social Revolution had the misfortune of proclaiming such a principle, it would mean its necessary failure; it would mean leaving the social problem, which past centuries have burdened us with, unsolved
  Of course, in a society like ours, in which the more a man works the less he is remunerated, this principle, at first sight, may appear to be a yearning for justice
 But in reality it is only the perpetuation of injustice
 It was by proclaiming this principle that wagedom began, to end in the glaring inequalities and all the abominations of present society; because, from the moment work done began to be appraised in currency, or in any other form of wage, the day it was agreed upon that man would only receive the wage he should be able to secure to himself, the whole history of a State-aided Capitalist Society was as good as written; it was contained in germ in this principle
  Shall we, then, return to our starting-point, and go through the same evolution again? Our theorists desire it, but fortunately it is impossible
 The Revolution, we maintain, must be communist; if not, it will be drowned in blood, and have to be begun over again
  Services rendered to society, be they work in factory or field, or mental services, _cannot be_ valued in money
 There can be no exact measure of value (of what has been wrongly termed exchange value), nor of use value, in terms of production
 If two individuals work for the community five hours a day, year in year out, at different work which is equally agreeable to them, we may say that on the whole their labour is approximately equivalent
 But we cannot divide their work, and say that the result of any particular day, hour, or minute of work of the one is worth the result of one day, one hour, or one minute of the other
  We may roughly say that the man, who during his lifetime has deprived himself of leisure during ten hours a day has given far more to society than the one who has only deprived himself of leisure during five hours a day, or who has not deprived himself at all
 But we cannot take what he has done during two hours, and say that the yield of his two hours' work is worth twice as much as the yield of another individual, who has worked only one hour, and remunerate the two in proportion
 It would be disregarding all that is complex in industry, in agriculture, in the whole life of present society; it would be ignoring to what extent all individual work is the result of the past and the present labour of society as a whole
 It would mean believing ourselves to be living in the Stone Age, whereas we are living in an age of steel
  If you enter a modern coal-mine you will see a man in charge of a huge machine that raises and lowers a cage
 In his hand he holds a lever that stops and reverses the course of the machine; he lowers it and the cage reverses its course in the twinkling of an eye; he sends it upwards or downwards into the depths of the shaft with a giddy swiftness
 All attention, he follows with his eyes fixed on an indicator which shows him, on a small scale, at which point of the shaft the cage is at each second of its progress; and as soon as the indicator has reached a certain level, he suddenly stops the course of the cage, not a yard higher nor lower than the required spot
 And no sooner have the colliers unloaded their coal-wagonettes, and pushed empty ones instead, than he reverses the lever and again sends the cage back into space
  During eight or ten consecutive hours every day he must keep the same strain of attention
 Should his brain relax for a moment, the cage would inevitably strike against the gear, break its wheels, snap the rope, crush men, and put a stop to all work in the mine
 Should he waste three seconds at each touch of the lever,--the extraction, in our modern, perfected mines, would be reduced from twenty to fifty tons a day
  Is it he who is the most necessary man in the mine? Or, is it perhaps the boy who signals to him from below to raise the cage? Is it the miner at the bottom of the shaft, who risks his life every instant, and who will some day be killed by fire-damp? Or is it the engineer, who would lose the layer of coal, and would cause the miners to dig on rock by a simple mistake in his calculations? Or is it the mine owner who has put his capital into the mine, and who has perhaps, contrary to expert advice, asserted that excellent coal would be found there?  All those who are engaged in the mine contribute to the extraction of coal in proportion to their strength, their energy, their knowledge, their intelligence, and their skill
 And we may say that all have the right to _live_, to satisfy their needs, and even their whims, when the necessaries of life have been secured for all
 But how can we appraise the work of each one of them?  And, moreover, Is the coal they have extracted entirely _their_ work? Is it not also the work of the men who have built the railway leading to the mine and the roads that radiate from all the railway stations? Is it not also the work of those that have tilled and sown the fields, extracted iron, cut wood in the forests, built the machines that burn coal, slowly developed the mining industry altogether, and so on?  It is utterly impossible to draw a distinction between the work of each of those men
 To measure the work by its results leads us to an absurdity; to divide the total work, and to measure its fractions by the number of hours spent on the work also leads us to absurdity
 One thing remains: to put the _needs_ above the _works_, and first of all to recognize _the right to live_, and later on _the right to well-being_ for all those who took their share in production
  But take any other branch of human activity--take the manifestations of life as a whole
 Which one of us can claim the higher remuneration for his work? Is it the doctor who has found out the illness, or the nurse who has brought about recovery by her hygienic care? Is it the inventor of the first steam-engine, or the boy, who, one day getting tired of pulling the rope that formerly opened the valve to let steam under the piston, tied the rope to the lever of the machine, without suspecting that he had invented the essential mechanical part of all modern machinery--the automatic valve?  Is it the inventor of the locomotive, or the workman of Newcastle, who suggested replacing the stones formerly laid under the rails by wooden sleepers, as the stones, for want of elasticity, caused the trains to derail? Is it the engineer on the locomotive? The signalman who stops the trains, or lets them pass by? The switchman who transfers a train from one line to another?  Again, to whom do we owe the transatlantic cable? Is it to the electrical engineer who obstinately affirmed that the cable would transmit messages while learned men of science declared it to be impossible? Is it to Maury, the learned physical geographer, who advised that thick cables should be set aside for others as thin as a walking cane? Or else to those volunteers, come from nobody knows where, who spent their days and nights on deck minutely examining every yard of the cable, and removed the nails that the shareholders of steamship companies stupidly caused to be driven into the non-conducting wrapper of the cable, so as to make it unserviceable?  And in a wider sphere, the true sphere of life, with its joys, its sufferings, and its accidents, cannot each one of us recall someone who has rendered him so great a service that we should be indignant if its equivalent in coin were mentioned? The service may have been but a word, nothing but a word spoken at the right time, or else it may have been months and years of devotion, and we are going to appraise these "incalculable" services in "labour-notes"?  "The works of each!" But human society would not exist for more than two consecutive generations if everyone did not give infinitely more than that for which he is paid in coin, in "cheques," or in civic rewards
 The race would soon become extinct if mothers did not sacrifice their lives to take care of their children, if men did not give continually, without demanding an equivalent reward, if men did not give most precisely when they expect no reward
  If middle-class society is decaying, if we have got into a blind alley from which we cannot emerge without attacking past institutions with torch and hatchet, it is precisely because we have given too much to counting
 It is because we have let ourselves be influenced into _giving_ only to _receive
_ It is because we have aimed at turning society into a commercial company based on _debit_ and _credit_
  After all, the Collectivists know this themselves
 They vaguely understand that a society could not exist if it carried out the principle of "Each according to his deeds
" They have a notion that _necessaries_--we do not speak of whims--the needs of the individual, do not always correspond to his _works_
 Thus De Paepe tells us: "The principle--the eminently Individualist principle--would, however, be _tempered_ by social intervention for the education of children and young persons (including maintenance and lodging), and by the social organization for assisting the infirm and the sick, for retreats for aged workers, etc
" They understand that a man of forty, father of three children, has other needs than a young man of twenty
 They know that the woman who suckles her infant and spends sleepless nights at its bedside, cannot do as much _work_ as the man who has slept peacefully
 They seem to take in that men and women, worn out maybe by dint of overwork for society, may be incapable of doing as much _work_ as those who have spent their time leisurely and pocketed their "labour-notes" in the privileged career of State functionaries
  They are eager to temper their principle
 They say: "Society will not fail to maintain and bring up its children; to help both aged and infirm
 Without doubt _needs_ will be the measure of the cost that society will burden itself with, to temper the principle of deeds
"  Charity, charity, always Christian charity, organized by the State this time
 They believe in improving the asylums for foundlings, in effecting old-age and sick insurances--so as to _temper_ their principle
 But they cannot yet throw aside the idea of "wounding first and healing afterwards"!  Thus, after having denied Communism, after having laughed at their ease at the formula--"To each according to his needs"--these great economists discover that they have forgotten something, the needs of the producers, which they now admit
 Only it is for the State to estimate them, for the State to verify if the needs are not disproportionate to the work
  The State will dole out charity
 Thence to the English poor-law and the workhouse is but a step
  There is but a slight difference, because even this stepmother of a society against whom we are in revolt has also been compelled to _temper_ her individualist principles; she, too, has had to make concessions in a communist direction and under the same form of charity
  She, too, distributes halfpenny dinners to prevent the pillaging of her shops; builds hospitals--often very bad ones, but sometimes splendid ones--to prevent the ravages of contagious diseases
 She, too, after having paid the hours of labour, shelters the children of those she has wrecked
 She takes their needs into consideration and doles out charity
  Poverty, we have said elsewhere, was the primary cause of wealth
 It was poverty that created the first capitalist; because, before accumulating "surplus value," of which we hear so much, men had to be sufficiently destitute to consent to sell their labour, so as not to die of hunger
 It was poverty that made capitalists
 And if the number of the poor increased so rapidly during the Middle Ages, it was due to the invasions and wars that followed the founding of States, and to the increase of riches resulting from the exploitation of the East
 These two causes tore asunder the bonds that kept men together in the agrarian and urban communities, and taught them to proclaim the principle of _wages_, so dear to the exploiters, instead of the solidarity they formerly practiced in their tribal life
  And it is this principle that is to spring from a revolution which men dare to call by the name of Social Revolution,--a name so dear to the starved, the oppressed, and the sufferers!  It can never be
 For the day on which old institutions will fall under the proletarian axe, voices will cry out: "Bread, shelter, ease for all!" And those voices will be listened to; the people will say: "Let us begin by allaying our thirst for life, for happiness, for liberty, that we have never quenched
 And when we shall have tasted of this joy, we will set to work to demolish the last vestiges of middle-class rule: its morality drawn from account books, its 'debit and credit' philosophy, its 'mine and yours' institutions
 'In demolishing we shall build,' as Proudhon said; and we shall build in the name of Communism and Anarchy
"     CHAPTER XIV  CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION   I  Looking at society and its political organization from a different standpoint than that of all the authoritarian schools--for we start from a free individual to reach a free society, instead of beginning by the State to come down to the individual--we follow the same method in economic questions
 We study the needs of the individuals, and the means by which they satisfy them, before discussing Production, Exchange, Taxation, Government, and so on
 At first sight the difference may appear trifling, but in reality it upsets all the canons of official Political Economy
  If you open the works of any economist you will find that he begins with PRODUCTION, _i
 e
_, by the analysis of the means employed nowadays for the creation of wealth: division of labour, the factory, its machinery, the accumulation of capital
 From Adam Smith to Marx, all have proceeded along these lines
 Only in the latter parts of their books do they treat of CONSUMPTION, that is to say, of the means resorted to in our present Society to satisfy the needs of the individuals; and even there they confine themselves to explaining how riches _are_ divided among those who vie with one another for their possession
  Perhaps you will say this is logical
 Before satisfying needs you must create the wherewithal to satisfy them
 But, before producing anything, must you not feel the need of it? Was it not necessity that first drove man to hunt, to raise cattle, to cultivate land, to make implements, and later on to invent machinery? Is it not the study of the needs that should govern production? To say the least, it would therefore be quite as logical to begin by considering the needs, and afterwards to discuss how production is, and ought to be, organized, in order to satisfy these needs
  This is precisely what we mean to do
  But as soon as we look at Political Economy from this point of view, it entirely changes its aspect
 It ceases to be a simple description of facts, and becomes a _science_, and we may define this science as: "_The study of the needs of mankind, and the means of satisfying them with the least possible waste of human energy_"
 Its true name should be, _Physiology of Society_
 It constitutes a parallel science to the physiology of plants and animals, which is the study of the needs of plants and animals, and of the most advantageous ways of satisfying them
 In the series of sociological sciences, the economy of human societies takes the place, occupied in the series of biological sciences by the physiology of organic bodies
  We say, here are human beings, united in a society
 All of them feel the need of living in healthy houses
 The savage's hut no longer satisfies them; they require a more or less comfortable solid shelter
 The question is, then: whether, taking the present capacity of men for production, every man can have a house of his own? and what is hindering him from having it?  And as soon as we ask _this_ question, we see that every family in Europe could perfectly well have a comfortable house, such as are built in England, in Belgium, or in Pullman City, or else an equivalent set of rooms
 A certain number of days' work would suffice to build a pretty little airy house, well fitted up and lighted by electricity
  But nine-tenths of Europeans have never possessed a healthy house, because at all times common people have had to work day after day to satisfy the needs of their rulers, and have never had the necessary leisure or money to build, or to have built, the home of their dreams
 And they can have no houses, and will inhabit hovels as long as present conditions remain unchanged
  It is thus seen that our method is quite contrary to that of the economists, who immortalize the so-called _laws_ of production, and, reckoning up the number of houses built every year, demonstrate by statistics, that as the number of the new-built houses _is_ too small to meet all demands, nine-tenths of Europeans _must_ live in hovels
  Let us pass on to food
 After having enumerated the benefits accruing from the division of labour, economists tell us the division of labour requires that some men should work at agriculture and others at manufacture
 Farmers producing so much, factories so much, exchange being carried on in such a way, they analyze the sale, the profit, the net gain or the surplus value, the wages, the taxes, banking, and so on
  But after having followed them so far, we are none the wiser, and if we ask them: "How is it that millions of human beings are in want of bread, when every family could grow sufficient wheat to feed ten, twenty, and even a hundred people annually?" they answer us by droning the same anthem--division of labour, wages, surplus value, capital, etc
--arriving at the same conclusion, that production is insufficient to satisfy all needs; a conclusion which, if true, does not answer the question: "Can or cannot man by his labour produce the bread he needs? And if he cannot, what is it that hinders him?"  Here are 350 million Europeans
 They need so much bread, so much meat, wine, milk, eggs, and butter every year
 They need so many houses, so much clothing
 This is the minimum of their needs
 Can they produce all this? and if they can, will sufficient leisure be left them for art, science, and amusement?--in a word, for everything that is not comprised in the category of absolute necessities? If the answer is in the affirmative,--What hinders them going ahead? What must they do to remove the obstacles? Is it time that is needed to achieve such a result? Let them take it! But let us not lose sight of the aim of production--the satisfaction of the needs of all
  If the most imperious needs of man remain unsatisfied now,--What must we do to increase the productivity of our work? But is there no other cause? Might it not be that production, having lost sight of the _needs_ of man, has strayed in an absolutely wrong direction, and that its organization is at fault? And as we can prove that such is the case, let us see how to reorganize production so as to really satisfy all needs
  This seems to us the only right way of facing things
 The only way that would allow of Political Economy becoming a science--the Science of Social Physiology
  It is evident that so long as science treats of production, as _it is_ carried on at present by civilized nations, by Hindoo communes, or by savages, it can hardly state facts otherwise than the economists state them now; that is to say, as a simple _descriptive_ chapter, analogous to the descriptive chapters of Zoology and Botany
 But if this chapter were written so as to throw some light on the economy of the energy that is necessary to satisfy human needs, the chapter would gain in precision, as well as in descriptive value
 It would clearly show the frightful waste of human energy under the present system, and it would prove that as long as this system exists, the needs of humanity will never be satisfied
  The point of view, we see, would be entirely changed
 Behind the loom that weaves so many yards of cloth, behind the steel-plate perforator, and behind the safe in which dividends are hoarded, we should see man, the artisan of production, more often than not excluded from the feast he has prepared for others
 We should also understand that the standpoint being wrong, the so-called "laws" of value and exchange are but a very false explanation of events, as they happen nowadays; and that things will come to pass very differently when production is organized in such a manner as to meet all needs of society
   II  There is not one single principle of Political Economy that does not change its aspect if you look at it from our point of view
  Take, for instance, over-production, a word which every day re-echoes in our ears
 Is there a single economist, academician, or candidate for academical honours, who has not supported arguments, proving that economic crises are due to over-production--that at a given moment more cotton, more cloth, more watches are produced than are needed! Have we not, all of us, thundered against the rapacity of the capitalists who are obstinately bent on producing more than can possibly be consumed!  However, on careful examination all these reasonings prove unsound
 In fact, Is there one single commodity among those in universal use which is produced in greater quantity than need be
 Examine one by one all commodities sent out by countries exporting on a large scale, and you will see that nearly all are produced in _insufficient_ quantities for the inhabitants of the countries exporting them
  It is not a surplus of wheat that the Russian peasant sends to Europe
 The most plentiful harvests of wheat and rye in European Russia only yield _enough_ for the population
 And as a rule, the peasant deprives himself of what he actually needs when he sells his wheat or rye to pay rent and taxes
  It is not a surplus of coal that England sends to the four corners of the globe, because only three-quarters of a ton, per head of population, annually, remains for home domestic consumption, and millions of Englishmen are deprived of fire in the winter, or have only just enough to boil a few vegetables
 In fact, setting aside useless luxuries, there is in England, which exports more than any other country, one single commodity in universal use--cottons--whose production is sufficiently great to _perhaps_ exceed the needs of the community
 Yet when we look upon the rags that pass for wearing apparel worn by over a third of the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, we are led to ask ourselves whether the cottons exported would not, on the whole, suit the _real_ needs of the population?  As a rule it is not a surplus that is exported, though it may have been so originally
 The fable of the barefooted shoemaker is as true of nations as it was formerly of individual artisans
 We export the _necessary_ commodities
 And we do so, because the workmen cannot buy with their wages what they have produced, _and pay besides the rent and interest to the capitalist and the banker_
  Not only does the ever-growing need of comfort remain unsatisfied, but the strict necessities of life are often wanting
 Therefore, "surplus production" does _not_ exist, at least not in the sense given to it by the theorists of Political Economy
  Taking another point--all economists tell us that there is a well-proved law: "Man produces more than he consumes
" After he has lived on the proceeds of his toil, there remains a surplus
 Thus, a family of cultivators produces enough to feed several families, and so forth
  For us, this oft-repeated sentence has no sense
 If it meant that each generation leaves something to future generations, it would be true; thus, for example, a farmer plants a tree that will live, maybe, for thirty, forty, or a hundred years, and whose fruits will still be gathered by the farmer's grandchildren
 Or he clears a few acres of virgin soil, and we say that the heritage of future generations has been increased by that much
 Roads, bridges, canals, his house and his furniture are so much wealth bequeathed to succeeding generations
  But this is not what is meant
 We are told that the cultivator produces more than he _need_ consume
 Rather should they say that, the State having always taken from him a large share of his produce for taxes, the priest for tithe, and the landlord for rent, a whole class of men has been created, who formerly consumed what they produced--save what was set aside for unforeseen accidents, or expenses incurred in afforestation, roads, etc
--but who to-day are compelled to live very poorly, from hand to mouth, the remainder having been taken from them by the State, the landlord, the priest, and the usurer
  Therefore we prefer to say: The agricultural labourer, the industrial worker and so on _consume less than they produce_,--because they are _compelled_ to sell most of the produce of their labour and to be satisfied with but a small portion of it
  Let us also observe that if the needs of the individual are taken as the starting-point of our political economy, we cannot fail to reach Communism, an organization which enables us to satisfy all needs in the most thorough and economical way
 While if we start from our present method of production, and aim at gain and surplus value, without asking whether our production corresponds to the satisfaction of needs, we necessarily arrive at Capitalism, or at most at Collectivism--both being but two different forms of the present wages' system
  In fact, when we consider the needs of the individual and of society, and the means which man has resorted to in order to satisfy them during his varied phases of development, we see at once the necessity of systematizing our efforts, instead of producing haphazard as we do nowadays
 It becomes evident that the appropriation by a few of all riches not consumed, and transmitted from one generation to another, is not in the general interest
 And we see as a fact that owing to these methods the needs of three-quarters of society are _not_ satisfied, so that the present waste of human strength in useless things is only the more criminal
  We discover, moreover, that the most advantageous use of all commodities would be, for each of them, to go, first, for satisfying those needs which are the most pressing: that, in other words, the so-called "value in use" of a commodity does not depend on a simple whim, as has often been affirmed, but on the satisfaction it brings to _real_ needs
  Communism--that is to say, an organization which would correspond to a view of Consumption, Production, and Exchange, taken as a whole--therefore becomes the logical consequence of such a comprehension of things--the only one, in our opinion, that is really scientific
  A society that will satisfy the needs of all, and which will know how to organize production to answer to this aim will also have to make a clean sweep of several prejudices concerning industry, and first of all the theory often preached by economists--_The Division of Labour_ theory--which we are going to discuss in the next chapter
     CHAPTER XV  THE DIVISION OF LABOUR   Political Economy has always confined itself to stating facts occurring in society, and justifying them in the interest of the dominant class
 Therefore, it pronounces itself in favour of the division of labour in industry
 Having found it profitable to capitalists, it has set it up as a _principle_
  Look at the village smith, said Adam Smith, the father of modern Political Economy
 If he has never been accustomed to making nails he will only succeed by hard toil in forging two or three hundred a day, and even then they will be bad
 But if this same smith has never made anything but nails, he will easily supply as many as two thousand three hundred in the course of a day
 And Smith hastened to the conclusion--"Divide labour, specialize, go on specializing; let us have smiths who only know how to make heads or points of nails, and by this means we shall produce more
 We shall grow rich
"  That a smith condemned for life to make the heads of nails would lose all interest in his work, that he would be entirely at the mercy of his employer with his limited handicraft, that he would be out of work four months out of twelve, and that his wages would fall very low down, when it would be easy to replace him by an apprentice, Smith did not think of all this when he exclaimed--"Long live the division o£ labour
 This is the real gold-mine that will enrich the nation!" And all joined him in this cry
  And later on, when a Sismondi or a J
 B
 Say began to understand that the division of labour, instead of enriching the whole nation, only enriches the rich, and that the worker, who is doomed for life to making the eighteenth part of a pin, grows stupid and sinks into poverty--what did official economists propose? Nothing! They did not say to themselves that by a lifelong grind at one and the same mechanical toil the worker would lose his intelligence and his spirit of invention, and that, on the contrary, a variety of occupations would result in considerably augmenting the productivity of a nation
 But this is the very issue we have now to consider
  If, however, learned economists were the only ones to preach the permanent and often hereditary division of labour, we might allow them to preach it as much as they pleased
 But the ideas taught by doctors of science filter into men's minds and pervert them; and from repeatedly hearing the division of labour, profits, interest, credit, etc
, spoken of as problems long since solved, all middle-class people, and workers too, end by arguing like economists; they venerate the same fetishes
  Thus we see most socialists, even those who have not feared to point out the mistakes of economical science, justifying the division of labour
 Talk to them about the organization of work during the Revolution, and they answer that the division of labour must be maintained; that if you sharpened pins before the Revolution you must go on sharpening them after
 True, you will not have to work more than five hours a day, but you will have to sharpen pins all your life, while others will make designs for machines that will enable you to sharpen hundreds of millions of pins during your life-time; and others again will be specialists in the higher branches of literature, science, and art, etc
 You were born to sharpen pins while Pasteur was born to invent the inoculation against anthrax, and the Revolution will leave you both to your respective employments
 Well, it is this horrible principle, so noxious to society, so brutalizing to the individual, source of so much harm, that we propose to discuss in its divers manifestations
  We know the consequences of the division of labour full well
 It is evident that, first of all, we are divided into two classes: on the one hand, producers, who consume very little and are exempt from thinking because they only do physical work, and who work badly because their brains remain inactive; and on the other hand, the consumers, who, producing little or hardly anything, have the privilege of thinking for the others, and who think badly because the whole world of those who toil with their hands is unknown to them
 Then, we have the labourers of the soil who know nothing of machinery, while those who work at machinery ignore everything about agriculture
 The idea of modern industry is a child _tending_ a machine that he cannot and must not understand, and a foreman who fines him if his attention flags for a moment
 The ideal of industrial agriculture is to do away with the agricultural labourer altogether and to set a man who does odd jobs to tend a steam-plough or a threshing-machine
 The division of labour means labelling and stamping men for life--some to splice ropes in factories, some to be foremen in a business, others to shove huge coal-baskets in a particular part of a mine; but none of them to have any idea of machinery as a whole, nor of business, nor of mines
 And thereby they destroy the love of work and the capacity for invention that, at the beginning of modern industry, created the machinery on which we pride ourselves so much
  What they have done for individuals, they also wanted to do for nations
 Humanity was to be divided into national workshops, having each its speciality
 Russia, we were taught, was destined by nature to grow corn; England to spin cotton; Belgium to weave cloth; while Switzerland was to train nurses and governesses
 Moreover, each separate city was to establish a specialty
 Lyons was to weave silk, Auvergne to make lace, and Paris fancy articles
 In this way, economists said, an immense field was opened for production and consumption, and in this way an era of limitless wealth for mankind was at hand
  However, these great hopes vanished as fast as technical knowledge spread abroad
 As long as England stood alone as a weaver of cotton and as a metal-worker on a large scale; as long as only Paris made artistic fancy articles, etc
, all went well, economists could preach the so-called division of labour without being refuted
  But a new current of thought induced bye and bye all civilized nations to manufacture for themselves
 They found it advantageous to produce what they formerly received from other countries, or from their colonies, which in their turn aimed at emancipating themselves from the mother-country
 Scientific discoveries universalized the methods of production, and henceforth it was useless to pay an exorbitant price abroad for what could easily be produced at home
 And now we see already that this industrial revolution strikes a crushing blow at the theory of the division of labour which for a long time was supposed to be so sound
     CHAPTER XVI  THE DECENTRALIZATION OF INDUSTRY[10]   I  After the Napoleonic wars Britain had nearly succeeded in ruining the main industries which had sprung up in France at the end of the preceding century
 She also became mistress of the seas and had no rivals of importance
 She took in the situation, and knew how to turn its privileges and advantages to account
 She established an industrial monopoly, and, imposing upon her neighbours her prices for the goods she alone could manufacture, accumulated riches upon riches
  But as the middle-class Revolution of the eighteenth century had abolished serfdom and created a proletariat in France, French industry, hampered for a time in its flight, soared again, and from the second half of the nineteenth century France ceased to be a tributary of England for manufactured goods
 To-day she too has grown into a nation with an export trade
 She sells far more than sixty million pounds' worth of manufactured goods, and two-thirds of these goods are fabrics
 The number of Frenchmen working for export or living by their foreign trade, is estimated at three millions
  France is therefore no longer England's tributary
 In her turn she has striven to monopolize certain branches of foreign industry, such as silks and ready-made clothes, and has reaped immense profits therefrom; but she is on the point of losing this monopoly for ever, just as England is on the point of losing the monopoly of cotton goods
  Travelling eastwards, industry has reached Germany
 Fifty years ago Germany was a tributary of England and France for most manufactured commodities in the higher branches of industry
 It is no longer so
 In the course of the last fifty years, and especially since the Franco-German war, Germany has completely reorganized her industry
 The new factories are stocked with the best machinery; the latest creations of industrial art in cotton goods from Manchester, or in silks from Lyons, etc
, are now realized in new German factories
 It took two or three generations of workers, at Lyons and Manchester, to construct the modern machinery; but Germany adopted it in its perfected state
 Technical schools, adapted to the needs of industry, supply the factories with an army of intelligent workmen--practical engineers, who can work with both hand and brain
 German industry starts at the point which was only reached by Manchester and Lyons after fifty years of groping in the dark, of exertion and experiments
  It follows that since Germany manufactures so well at home, she diminishes her imports from France and England year by year
 She has not only become their rival in manufactured goods in Asia and in Africa, but also in London and in Paris
 Shortsighted people in France may cry out against the Frankfort Treaty; English manufacturers may explain German competition by little differences in railway tariffs; they may linger on the petty side of questions, and neglect great historical facts
 But it is none the less certain that the main industries, formerly in the hands of England and France, have progressed eastward, and in Germany they have found a country, young, full of energy, possessing an intelligent middle class, and eager in its turn to enrich itself by foreign trade
  While Germany has freed herself from subjection to France and England, has manufactured her own cotton-cloth, and constructed her own machines--in fact, manufactured all commodities--the main industries have also taken root in Russia, where the development of manufacture is the more instructive as it sprang up but yesterday
  At the time of the abolition of serfdom in 1861, Russia had hardly any factories
 Everything needed in the way of machines, rails, railway-engines, fine dress materials, came from the West
 Twenty years later she possessed already 85,000 factories, and the value of the goods manufactured in Russia had increased fourfold
  The old machinery was superseded, and now nearly all the steel in use in Russia, three-quarters of the iron, two-thirds of the coal, all railway-engines, railway-carriages, rails, nearly all steamers, are made in Russia
  Russia, destined--so wrote economists--to remain an agricultural territory, has rapidly developed into a manufacturing country
 She orders hardly anything from England, and very little from Germany
  Economists hold the customs responsible for these facts, and yet cottons manufactured in Russia are sold at the same price as in London
 Capital taking no cognizance of father-lands, German and English capitalists, accompanied by engineers and foremen of their own nationalities, have introduced in Russia and in Poland manufactories whose goods compete in excellence with the best from England
 If customs were abolished to-morrow, manufacture would only gain by it
 Not long ago the British manufacturers delivered another hard blow to the import of cloth and woolens from the West
 They set up in southern and middle Russia immense wool factories, stocked with the most perfect machinery from Bradford, and already now Russia imports only the highest sorts of cloth and woolen fabrics from England, France and Austria
 The remainder is fabricated at home, both in factories and as domestic industries
  The main industries not only move eastward, they are spreading also to the southern peninsulas
 The Turin Exhibition of 1884 already demonstrated the progress made in Italian manufactured produce; and, let us not make any mistake about it, the mutual hatred of the French and Italian middle classes has no other origin than their industrial rivalry
 Spain is also becoming an industrial country; while in the East, Bohemia has suddenly sprung into importance as a new centre of manufactures, provided with perfected machinery and applying the best scientific methods
  We might also mention Hungary's rapid progress in the main industries, but let us rather take Brazil as an example
 Economists sentenced Brazil to cultivate cotton forever, to export it in its raw state, and to receive cotton-cloth from Europe in exchange
 In fact, forty years ago Brazil had only nine wretched little cotton factories with 385 spindles
 To-day there are 160 cotton-mills, possessing 1,500,000 spindles and 50,000 looms, which throw 500 million yards of textiles on the market annually
  Even Mexico is now very successful in manufacturing cotton-cloth, instead of importing it from Europe
 As to the United States they have quite freed themselves from European tutelage, and have triumphantly developed their manufacturing powers to an enormous extent
  But it was India which gave the most striking proof against the specialization of national industry
  We all know the theory: the great European nations need colonies, for colonies send raw material--cotton fibre, unwashed wool, spices, etc
, to the mother-land
 And the mother-land, under pretense of sending them manufactured wares, gets rid of her damaged stuffs, her machine scrap-iron and everything which she no longer has any use for
 It costs her little or nothing, and none the less the articles are sold at exorbitant prices
  Such was the theory--such was the practice for a long time
 In London and Manchester fortunes were made, while India was being ruined
 In the India Museum in London unheard of riches, collected in Calcutta and Bombay by English merchants, are to be seen
  But other English merchants and capitalists conceived the very simple idea that it would be more expedient to exploit the natives of India by making cotton-cloth in India itself, than to import from twenty to twenty-four million pounds' worth of goods annually
  At first a series of experiments ended in failure
 Indian weavers--artists and experts in their own craft--could not inure themselves to factory life; the machinery sent from Liverpool was bad; the climate had to be taken into account; and merchants had to adapt themselves to new conditions, now fully mastered, before British India could become the menacing rival of the Mother-land she is to-day
  She now possesses more than 200 cotton-mills which employ about 230,000 workmen, and contain more than 6,000,000 spindles and 80,000 looms, and 40 jute-mills, with 400,000 spindles
 She exports annually to China, to the Dutch Indies, and to Africa, nearly eight million pounds' worth of the same white cotton-cloth, said to be England's specialty
 And while English workmen are often unemployed and in great want, Indian women weave cotton by machinery, for the Far East at wages of six-pence a day
 In short, the intelligent manufacturers are fully aware that the day is not far off when they will not know what to do with the "factory hands" who formerly wove cotton-cloth for export from England
 Besides which it is becoming more and more evident that India will no import a single ton of iron from England
 The initial difficulties in using the coal and the iron-ore obtained in India have been overcome; and foundries, rivalling those in England, have been built on the shores of the Indian Ocean
  Colonies competing with the mother-land in its production of manufactured goods, such is the factor which will regulate economy in the twentieth century
  And why should India not manufacture? What should be the hindrance? Capital?--But capital goes wherever there are men, poor enough to be exploited
 Knowledge? But knowledge recognizes no national barriers
 Technical skill of the worker?--No
 Are, then, Hindoo workmen inferior to the hundreds of thousands of boys and girls, not eighteen years old, at present working in the English textile factories?   II  After having glanced at national industries it would be very interesting to turn to some special branches
  Let us take silk, for example, an eminently French produce in the first half of the nineteenth century
 We all know how Lyons became the emporium of the silk trade
 At first raw silk was gathered in southern France, till little by little they ordered it from Italy, from Spain, from Austria, from the Caucasus, and from Japan, for the manufacture of their silk fabrics
 In 1875, out of five million kilos of raw silk converted into stuffs in the vicinity of Lyons, there were only four hundred thousand kilos of French silk
 But if Lyons manufactured imported silk, why should not Switzerland, Germany, Russia, do as much? Consequently, silk-weaving began to develop in the villages round Zurich
 Bâle became a great centre of the silk trade
 The Caucasian Administration engaged women from Marseilles and workmen from Lyons to teach Georgians the perfected rearing of silk-worms, and the art of converting silk into fabrics to the Caucasian peasants
 Austria followed
 Then Germany, with the help of Lyons workmen, built great silk factories
 The United States did likewise at Paterson
  And to-day the silk trade is no longer a French monopoly
 Silks are made in Germany, in Austria, in the United States, and in England, and it is now reckoned that one-third of the silk stuffs used in France are imported
 In winter, Caucasian peasants weave silk handkerchiefs at a wage that would mean starvation to the silk-weavers of Lyons
 Italy and Germany send silks to France; and Lyons, which in 1870-4 exported 460 million francs' worth of silk fabrics, exports now only one-half of that amount
 In fact, the time is not far off when Lyons will only send higher class goods and a few novelties as patterns to Germany, Russia and Japan
  And so it is in all industries
 Belgium has no longer the cloth monopoly; cloth is made in Germany, in Russia, in Austria, in the United States
 Switzerland and the French Jura have no longer a clockwork monopoly; watches are made everywhere
 Scotland no longer refines sugar for Russia: refined Russian sugar is imported into England
 Italy, although neither possessing coal nor iron, makes her own iron-clads and engines for her steamers
 Chemical industry is no longer an English monopoly; sulphuric acid and soda are made even in the Urals
 Steam-engines, made at Winterthur, have acquired everywhere a wide reputation, and at the present moment, Switzerland, which has neither coal nor iron, and no sea-ports to import them--nothing but excellent technical schools--makes machinery better and cheaper than England
 So ends the theory of Exchange
  The tendency of trade, as for all else, is toward decentralization
  Every nation finds it advantageous to combine agriculture with the greatest possible variety of factories
 The specialization, of which economists spoke so highly, certainly has enriched a number of capitalists, but is now no longer of any use
 On the contrary, it is to the advantage of every region, every nation, to grow their own wheat, their own vegetables, and to manufacture at home most of the produce they consume
 This diversity is the surest pledge of the complete development of production by mutual co-operation, and the moving cause of progress, while specialization is now a hindrance to progress
  Agriculture can only prosper in proximity to factories
 And no sooner does a single factory appear than an infinite variety of other factories _must_ spring up around, so that, mutually supporting and stimulating one another by their inventions, they increase their productivity
   III  It is foolish indeed to export wheat and to import flour, to export wool and import cloth, to export iron and import machinery; not only because transportation is a waste of time and money, but, above all, because a country with no developed industry inevitably remains behind the times in agriculture; because a country with no large factories to bring steel to a finished condition is doomed to be backward in all other industries; and lastly, because the industrial and technical capacities of the nation remain undeveloped, if they are not exercised in a variety of industries
  Nowadays everything holds together in the world of production
 Cultivation of the soil is no longer possible without machinery, without great irrigation works, without railways, without manure factories
 And to adapt this machinery, these railways, these irrigation engines, etc
, to local conditions, a certain spirit of invention, and a certain amount of technical skill must be developed, while they necessarily lie dormant so long as spades and ploughshares are the only implements of cultivation
  If fields are to be properly cultivated, if they are to yield the abundant harvests that man has the right to expect, it is essential that workshops, foundries, and factories develop within the reach of the fields
 A variety of occupations, and a variety of skill arising therefrom, both working together for a common aim--these are the true forces of progress
  And now let us imagine the inhabitants of a city or a territory--whether vast or small--stepping for the first time on to the path of the Social Revolution
  We are sometimes told that "nothing will have changed": that the mines, the factories, etc
, will be expropriated, and proclaimed national or communal property, that every man will go back to his usual work, and that the Revolution will then be accomplished
  But this is a mere dream: the Social Revolution cannot take place so simply
  We have already mentioned that should the Revolution break out to-morrow in Paris, Lyons, or any other city--should the workers lay hands on factories, houses, and banks, present production would be completely revolutionized by this simple fact
  International commerce will come to a standstill; so also will the importation of foreign bread-stuffs; the circulation of commodities and of provisions will be paralyzed
 And then, the city or territory in revolt will be compelled to provide for itself, and to reorganize its production, so as to satisfy its own needs
 If it fails to do so, it is death
 If it succeeds, it will revolutionize the economic life of the country
  The quantity of imported provisions having decreased, consumption having increased, one million Parisians working for exportation purposes having been thrown out of work, a great number of things imported to-day from distant or neighbouring countries not reaching their destination, fancy-trade being temporarily at a standstill,--What will the inhabitants have to eat six months after the Revolution?  We think that when the stores containing food-stuffs are empty, the masses will seek to obtain their food from the land
 They will see the necessity of cultivating the soil, of combining agricultural production with industrial production in the suburbs of Paris itself and its environs
 They will have to abandon the merely ornamental trades and consider their most urgent need--bread
  A great number of the inhabitants of the cities will have to become agriculturists
 Not in the same manner as the present peasants who wear themselves out, ploughing for a wage that barely provides them with sufficient food for the year, but by following the principles of the intensive agriculture, of the market gardeners, applied on a large scale by means of the best machinery that man has invented or can invent
 They will till the land--not, however, like the country beast of burden: a Paris jeweller would object to that
 They will organize cultivation on better principles; and not in the future, but at once, during the revolutionary struggles, from fear of being worsted by the enemy
  Agriculture will have to be carried out on intelligent lines, by men and women availing themselves of the experience of the present time, organizing themselves in joyous gangs for pleasant work, like those who, a hundred years ago, worked in the Champ de Mars for the Feast of the Federation--a work of delight, when not carried to excess, when scientifically organized, when man invents and improves his tools and is conscious of being a useful member of the community
  Of course, they will not only cultivate wheat and oats--they will also produce those things which they formerly used to order from foreign parts
 And let us not forget that for the inhabitants of a revolted territory, "foreign parts" may include all districts that have not joined in the revolutionary movement
 During the Revolutions of 1793 and 1871 Paris was made to feel that "foreign parts" meant even the country district at her very gates
 The speculator in grains at Troyes starved in 1793 and 1794 the sansculottes of Paris as badly, and even worse, than the German armies brought on to French soil by the Versailles conspirators
 The revolted city will be compelled to do without these "foreigners," and why not? France invented beet-root sugar when sugar-cane ran short during the continental blockade
 Parisians discovered saltpetre in their cellars when they no longer received any from abroad
 Shall we be inferior to our grandfathers, who hardly lisped the first words of science?  A revolution is more than a mere change of the prevailing political system
 It implies the awakening of human intelligence, the increasing of the inventive spirit tenfold, a hundredfold; it is the dawn of a new science--the science of men like Laplace, Lamarck, Lavoisier
 It is a revolution in the minds of men, as deep, and deeper still, than in their institutions
  And there are still economists, who tell us that once the "revolution is made," everyone will return to his workshop, as if passing through a revolution were going home after a walk in the Epping forest!  To begin with, the sole fact of having laid hands on middle-class property will imply the necessity of completely reorganizing the whole of economic life in the workshops, the dockyards, the factories
  And the revolution surely will not fail to act in this direction
 Should Paris, during the social revolution, be cut off from the world for a year or two by the supporters of middle-class rule, its millions of intellects, not yet depressed by factory life--that City of little trades which stimulate the spirit of invention--will show the world what man's brain can accomplish without asking for help from without, but the motor force of the sun that gives light, the power of the wind that sweeps away impurities, and the silent life-forces at work in the earth we tread on
  We shall see then what a variety of trades, mutually cooperating on a spot of the globe and animated by a revolution, can do to feed, clothe, house, and supply with all manner of luxuries millions of intelligent men
  We need write no fiction to prove this
 What we are sure of, what has already been experimented upon, and recognized as practical, would suffice to carry it into effect, if the attempt were fertilized, vivified by the daring inspiration of the Revolution and the spontaneous impulse of the masses
  FOOTNOTE:  [10] A fuller development of these ideas will be found in my book, _Fields, Factories, and Workshops_, published by Messrs
 Thomas Nelson and Sons in their popular series in 1912
     CHAPTER XVII  AGRICULTURE   I  Political Economy has often been reproached with drawing all its deductions from the decidedly false principle, that the only incentive capable of forcing a man to augment his power of production is personal interest in its narrowest sense
  The reproach is perfectly true; so true that epochs of great industrial discoveries and true progress in industry are precisely those in which the happiness of all was inspiring men, and in which personal enrichment was least thought of
 The great investigators in science and the great inventors aimed, above all, at giving greater freedom of mankind
 And if Watt, Stephenson, Jacquard, etc
, could have only foreseen what a state of misery their sleepless nights would bring to the workers, they certainly would have burned their designs and broken their models
  Another principle that pervades Political Economy is just as false
 It is the tacit admission, common to all economists, that if there is often over-production in certain branches, a society will nevertheless never have sufficient products to satisfy the wants of all, and that consequently the day will never come when nobody will be forced to sell his labour in exchange for wages
 This tacit admission is found at the basis of all theories and all the so-called "laws" taught by economists
  And yet it is certain that the day when any civilized association of individuals would ask itself, _what are the needs of all, and the means of satisfying them_, it would see that, in industry, as in agriculture, it already possesses sufficient to provide abundantly for all needs, on condition that it knows how to apply these means to satisfy real needs
  That this is true as regards industry no one can contest
 Indeed, it suffices to study the processes already in use to extract coals and ore, to obtain steel and work it, to manufacture on a great scale what is used for clothing, etc
, in order to perceive that we could already increase our production fourfold or more, and yet use for that _less_ work than we are using now
  We go further
 We assert that agriculture is in the same position: those who cultivate the soil, like the manufacturers, already could increase their production, not only fourfold but tenfold, and they can put it into practice as soon as they feel the need of it,--as soon as a socialist organization of work will be established instead of the present capitalistic one
  Each time agriculture is spoken of, men imagine a peasant bending over the plough, throwing badly assorted corn haphazard into the ground and waiting anxiously for what the good or bad season will bring forth; they think of a family working from morn to night and reaping as reward a rude bed, dry bread, and coarse beverage
 In a word, they picture "the savages" of La Bruyère
  And for these men, ground down to such a misery, the utmost relief that society proposes, is to reduce their taxes or their rent
 But even most social reformers do not care to imagine a cultivator standing erect, taking leisure, and producing by a few hours' work per day sufficient food to nourish, not only his own family, but a hundred men more at the least
 In their most glowing dreams of the future Socialists do not go beyond American extensive culture, which, after all, is but the infancy of agricultural art
  But the thinking agriculturist has broader ideas to-day--his conceptions are on a far grander scale
 He only asks for a fraction of an acre in order to produce sufficient vegetables for a family; and to feed twenty-five horned beasts he needs no more space than he formerly required to feed one; his aim is to make his own soil, to defy seasons and climate, to warm both air and earth around the young plant; to produce, in a word, on one acre what he used to gather from fifty acres, and that without any excessive fatigue--by greatly reducing, on the contrary, the total of former labour
 He knows that we will be able to feed everybody by giving to the culture of the fields no more time than what each can give with pleasure and joy
  This is the present tendency of agriculture
  While scientific men, led by Liebig, the creator of the chemical theory of agriculture, often got on the wrong tack in their love of mere theories, unlettered agriculturists opened up new roads to prosperity
 Market-gardeners of Paris, Troyes, Rouen, Scotch and English gardeners, Flemish and Lombardian farmers, peasants of Jersey, Guernsey, and farmers on the Scilly Isles have opened up such large horizons that the mind hesitates to grasp them
 While up till lately a family of peasants needed at least seventeen to twenty acres to live on the produce of the soil--and we know how peasants live--we can now no longer say what is the minimum area on which all that is necessary to a family can be grown, even including articles of luxury, if the soil is worked by means of intensive culture
  Twenty years ago it could already be asserted that a population of thirty million individuals could live very well, without importing anything, on what could be grown in Great Britain
 But now, when we see the progress recently made in France, in Germany, in England, and when we contemplate the new horizons which open before us, we can say that in cultivating the earth as it is already cultivated in many places, even on poor soils, fifty or sixty million inhabitants to the territory of Great Britain would still be a very feeble proportion to what man could extract from the soil
  In any case (as we are about to demonstrate) we may consider it as absolutely proved that if to-morrow Paris and the two departments of Seine and of Seine-et-Oise organized themselves as an Anarchist commune, in which all worked with their hands, and if the entire universe refused to send them a single bushel of wheat, a single head of cattle, a single basket of fruit, and left them only the territory of the two departments, they could not only produce all the corn, meat, and vegetables necessary for themselves, but also vegetables and fruit which are now articles of luxury, in sufficient quantities for all
  And, in addition, we affirm that the sum total of this labour would be far less than that expended at present to feed these people with corn harvested in Auvergne and Russia, with vegetables produced a little everywhere by extensive agriculture, and with fruit grown in the South
  It is self-evident that we in nowise desire all exchange to be suppressed, nor that each region should strive to produce that which will only grow in its climate by a more or less artificial culture
 But we care to draw attention to the fact that the theory of exchange, such as is understood to-day, is strangely exaggerated--that exchange is often useless and even harmful
 We assert, moreover, that people have never had a right conception of the immense labour of Southern wine growers, nor that of Russian and Hungarian corn growers, whose excessive labour could also be very much reduced if they adopted intensive culture, instead of their present system of extensive agriculture
   II  It would be impossible to quote here the mass of facts on which we base our assertions
 We are therefore obliged to refer our readers who want further information to another book, "Fields, Factories, and Workshops
"[11] Above all we earnestly invite those who are interested in the question to read several excellent works published in France and elsewhere, and of which we give a list at the close of this book[12]
 As to the inhabitants of large towns, who have as yet no real notion of what agriculture can be, we advise them to explore the surrounding market-gardens
 They need but observe and question the market-gardeners, and a new world will be open to them
 They will then be able to see what European agriculture may be in the twentieth century; and they will understand with what force the social revolution will be armed when we know the secret of taking everything we need from the soil
  A few facts will suffice to show that our assertions are in no way exaggerated
 We only wish them to be preceded by a few general remarks
  We know in what a wretched condition European agriculture is
 If the cultivator of the soil is not plundered by the landowner, he is robbed by the State
 If the State taxes him moderately, the money-lender enslaves him by means of promissory notes, and soon turns him into the simple tenant of soil belonging in reality to a financial company
 The landlord, the State, and the banker thus plunders the cultivator by means of rent, taxes, and interest
 The sum varies in each country, but it never falls below the quarter, very often the half of the raw produce
 In France and in Italy agriculturists paid the State quite recently as much as 44 per cent
 of the gross produce
  Moreover, the share of the owner and of State always goes on increasing
 As soon as the cultivator has obtained more plentiful crops by prodigies of labour, invention, or initiative, the tribute he will owe to the landowner, the State, and the banker will augment in proportion
 If he doubles the number of bushels reaped per acre, rent will be doubled, and taxes too, and the State will take care to raise them still more if the prices go up
 And so on
 In short, everywhere the cultivator of the soil works twelve to sixteen hours a day; these three vultures take from him everything he might lay by; they rob him everywhere of what would enable him to improve his culture
 This is why agriculture progresses so slowly
  The cultivator can only occasionally make some progress, in some exceptional regions, under quite exceptional circumstances, following upon a quarrel between the three vampires
 And yet we have said nothing about the tribute every cultivator pays to the manufacturer
 Every machine, every spade, every barrel of chemical manure, is sold to him at three or four times its real cost
 Nor let us forget the middleman, who levies the lion's share of the earth's produce
  This is why, during all this century of invention and progress, agriculture has only improved from time to time on very limited areas
  Happily there have always been small oases, neglected for some time by the vulture; and here we learn what intensive agriculture can produce for mankind
 Let us mention a few examples
  In the American prairies (which, however, only yield meagre spring wheat crops, from 7 to 15 bushels acre, and even these are often marred by periodical droughts), 500 men, working only during eight months, produce the annual food of 50,000 people
 With all the improvements of the last three years, one man's yearly labour (300 days) yields, delivered in Chicago as flour, the yearly food of 250 men
 Here the result is obtained by a great economy in manual labour: on those vast plains, ploughing, harvesting, thrashing, are organized in almost military fashion
 There is no useless running to and fro, no loss of time--all is done with parade-like precision
  This is agriculture on a large scale--extensive agriculture, which takes the soil from nature without seeking to improve it
 When the earth has yielded all it can, they leave it; they seek elsewhere for a virgin soil, to be exhausted in its turn
 But here is also "intensive" agriculture, which is already worked, and will be more and more so, by machinery
 Its object is to cultivate a limited space well, to manure, to improve, to concentrate work, and to obtain the largest crop possible
 This kind of culture spreads every year, and whereas agriculturists in the south of France and on the fertile plains of western America are content with an average crop of 11 to 15 bushels per acre by extensive culture, they reap regularly 39, even 55, and sometimes 60 bushels per acre in the north of France
 The annual consumption of a man is thus obtained from less than a quarter of an acre
  And the more intense the culture is, the less work is expended to obtain a bushel of wheat
 Machinery replaces man at the preliminary work and for the improvements needed by the land--such as draining, clearing of stones--which will double the crops in future, once and for ever
 Sometimes nothing but keeping the soil free of weeds, without manuring, allows an average soil to yield excellent crops from year to year
 It has been done for forty years in succession at Rothamstead, in Hertfordshire
  However, let us not write an agricultural romance, but be satisfied with a crop of 44 bushels per acre
 That needs no exceptional soil, but merely a rational culture; and let us see what it means
  The 3,600,000 individuals who inhabit the two departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise consume yearly for their food a little less than 22 million bushels of cereals, chiefly wheat; and in our hypothesis they would have to cultivate, in order to obtain this crop, 494,200 acres out of the 1,507,300 acres which they possess
 It is evident they would not cultivate them with spades
 That would need too much time--96 work-days of 5 hours per acre
 It would be preferable to improve the soil once for all--to drain what needed draining, to level what needed levelling, to clear the soil of stones, were it even necessary to spend 5 million days of 5 hours in this preparatory work--an average of 10 work-days to each acre
  Then they would plough with the steam-digger, which would take one and three-fifths of a day per acre, and they would give another one and three-fifths of a day for working with the double plough
 Seeds would be sorted by steam instead of taken haphazard, and they would be carefully sown in rows instead of being thrown to the four winds
 Now all this work would not take 10 days of 5 hours per acre if the work were done under good conditions
 But if 10 million work-days are given to good culture during 3 or 4 years, the result will be that later on crops of 44 to 55 bushels per acre will be obtained by only working half the time
  Fifteen million work-days will thus have been spent to give bread to a population of 3,600,000 inhabitants
 And the work would be such that everyone could do it without having muscles of steel, or without having even worked the ground before
 The initiative and the general distribution of work would come from those who know the soil
 As to the work itself, there is no townsman of either sex so enfeebled as to be incapable of looking after machines and of contributing his share to agrarian work after a few hours' apprenticeship
  Well, when we consider that in the present chaos there are, in a city like Paris, without counting the unemployed of the upper classes, there are always about 100,000 workmen out of work in their several trades, we see that the power lost in our present organization would alone suffice to give, with a rational culture, all the bread that is necessary for the three or four million inhabitants of the two departments
  We repeat, this is no fancy dream, and we have not yet spoken of the truly intensive agriculture
 We have not depended upon the wheat (obtained in three years by Mr
 Hallett) of which one grain, replanted, produced 5,000 or 6,000, and occasionally 10,000 grains, which would give the wheat necessary for a family of five individuals on an area of 120 square yards
 On the contrary, we have only mentioned what is being already achieved by numerous farmers in France, England, Belgium, etc
, and what might be done to-morrow with the experience and knowledge acquired already by practice on a large scale
  But without a revolution, neither to-morrow, nor after to-morrow will see it done, because it is not to the interest of landowners and capitalists; and because peasants who would find their profit in it have neither the knowledge nor the money, nor the time to obtain what is necessary to go ahead
  The society of to-day has not yet reached this stage
 But let Parisians proclaim an Anarchist Commune, and they will of necessity come to it, because they will not be foolish enough to continue making luxurious toys (which Vienna, Warsaw, and Berlin make as well already), and to run the risk of being left without bread
  Moreover, agricultural work, by the help of machinery, would soon become the most attractive and the most joyful of all occupations
  "We have had enough jewelery and enough dolls' clothes," they would say; "it is high time for the workers to recruit their strength in agriculture, to go in search of vigour, of impressions of nature, of the joy of life, that they have forgotten in the dark factories of the suburbs
"  In the Middle Ages it was Alpine pasture lands, rather than guns, which allowed the Swiss to shake off lords and kings
 Modern agriculture will allow a city in revolt to free itself from the combined bourgeois forces
   III  We have seen how the three and one-half million inhabitants of the two departments round Paris could find ample bread by cultivating only a third of their territory
 Let us now pass on to cattle
  Englishmen, who eat much meat, consume on an average a little less than 220 pounds a year per adult
 Supposing all meats consumed were oxen, that makes a little less than the third of an ox
 An ox a year for five individuals (including children) is already a sufficient ration
 For three and one-half million inhabitants this would make an annual consumption of 700,000 head of cattle
  To-day, with the pasture system, we need at least five million acres to nourish 660,000 head of cattle
 This makes nine acres per each head of horned cattle
 Nevertheless, with prairies moderately watered by spring water (as recently done on thousands of acres in the southwest of France), one and one-fourth million acres already suffice
 But if intensive culture is practiced, and beet-root is grown for fodder, you only need a quarter of that area, that is to say, about 310,000 acres
 And if we have recourse to maize and practice ensilage (the compression of fodder while green) like Arabs, we obtain fodder on an area of 217,500 acres
  In the environs of Milan, where sewer water is used to irrigate the fields, fodder for two to three horned cattle per each acre is obtained on an area of 22,000 acres; and on a few favoured fields, up to 177 tons of hay to the 10 acres have been cropped, the yearly provender of 36 milch cows
 Nearly nine acres per head of cattle are needed under the pasture system, and only two and one-half acres for nine oxen or cows under the new system
 These are the opposite extremes in modern agriculture
  In Guernsey, on a total of 9,884 acres utilized, nearly half (4,695 acres) are covered with cereals and kitchen-gardens; only 5,189 acres remain as meadows
 On these 5,189 acres, 1,480 horses, 7,260 head of cattle, 900 sheep, and 4,200 pigs are fed, which makes more than three head of cattle per two acres, without reckoning the sheep or the pigs
 It is needless to add that the fertility of the soil is made by seaweed and chemical manures
  Returning to our three and one-half million inhabitants belonging to Paris and its environs, we see that the land necessary for the rearing of cattle comes down from five million acres to 197,000
 Well, then, let us not stop at the lowest figures, let us take those of ordinary intensive culture; let us liberally add to the land necessary for smaller cattle which must replace some of the horned beasts and allow 395,000 acres for the rearing of cattle--494,000 if you like, on the 1,013,000 acres remaining after bread has been provided for the people
  Let us be generous and give five million work-days to put this land into a productive state
  After having therefore employed in the course of a year twenty million work-days, half of which are for permanent improvements, we shall have bread and meat assured to us, without including all the extra meat obtainable in the shape of fowls, pigs, rabbits, etc
; without taking into consideration that a population provided with excellent vegetables and fruit consumes less meat than Englishmen, who supplement their poor supply of vegetables by animal food
 Now, how much do twenty million work-days of five hours make per inhabitant? Very little indeed
 A population of three and one-half millions must have at least 1,200,000 adult men, and as many women capable of work
 Well, then, to give bread and meat to all, it would need only seventeen half-days of work a year per man
 Add three million work-days, or double that number if you like, in order to obtain milk
 That will make twenty-five work-days of five hours in all--nothing more than a little pleasureable country exercise--to obtain the three principal products: bread, meat, and milk
 The three products which, after housing, cause daily anxiety to nine-tenths of mankind
  And yet--let us not tire of repeating--these are not fancy dreams
 We have only told what is, what been, obtained by experience on a large scale
 Agriculture could be reorganized in this way to-morrow if property laws and general ignorance did not offer opposition
  The day Paris has understood that to know what you eat and how it is produced, is a question of public interest; the day when everybody will have understood that this question is infinitely more important than all the parliamentary debates of the present times--on that day the Revolution will be an accomplished fact
 Paris will take possession of the two departments and cultivate them
 And then the Parisian worker, after having laboured a third of his existence in order to buy bad and insufficient food, will produce it himself, under his walls, within the enclosure of his forts (if they still exist), and in a few hours of healthy and attractive work
  And now we pass on to fruit and vegetables
 Let us go outside Paris and visit the establishment of a market-gardener who accomplishes wonders (ignored by learned economists) at a few miles from the academies
  Let us visit, suppose, M
 Ponce, the author of a work on market-gardening, who makes no secret of what the earth yields him, and who has published it all along
  M
 Ponce, and especially his workmen, work like niggers
 It takes eight men to cultivate a plot a little less than three acres (2
7)
 They work twelve and even fifteen hours a day, that is to say, three times more than is needed
 Twenty-four of them would not be too many
 To which M
 Ponce will probably answer that as he pays the terrible sum of £100 rent a year for his 2
7 acres of land, and £100 for manure bought in the barracks, he is obliged to exploit
 He would no doubt answer, "Being exploited, I exploit in my turn
" His installation has also cost him £1,200, of which certainly more than half went as tribute to the idle barons of industry
 In reality, this establishment represents at most 3,000 work-days, probably much less
  But let us examine his crops: nearly ten tons of carrots, nearly ten tons of onions, radishes, and small vegetables, 6,000 heads of cabbage, 3,000 heads of cauliflower, 5,000 baskets of tomatoes, 5,000 dozen of choice fruit, 154,000 salads; in short, a total of 123 tons of vegetables and fruit to 2
7 acres--120 yards long by 109 yards broad, which makes more than forty-four tons of vegetables to the acre
  But a man does not eat more than 660 pounds of vegetables and fruit a year, and two and one-half acres of a market-garden yield enough vegetables and fruit to richly supply the table of 350 adults during the year
 Thus twenty-four persons employed a whole year in cultivating 2
7 acres of land, and only five working hours a day, would produce sufficient vegetables and fruit for 350 adults, which is equivalent at least to 500 individuals
  To put it another way: in cultivating like M
 Ponce--and his results have already been surpassed--350 adults should each give a little more than 100 hours a year (103) to produce vegetables and fruit necessary for 500 people
  Let us mention that such a production is not the exception
 It takes place, under the walls of Paris, on an area of 2,220 acres, by 5,000 market-gardeners
 Only these market-gardeners are reduced nowadays to a state of beasts of burden, in order to pay an average rent of £32 per acre
  But do not these facts, which can be verified by every one, prove that 17,300 acres (of the 519,000 remaining to us) would suffice to give all necessary vegetables, as well as a liberal amount of fruit to the three and one-half million inhabitants of our two departments?  As to the quantity of work necessary to produce these fruits and vegetables, it would amount to fifty million work-days of five hours (50 days per adult male), if we measure by the market-gardeners' standard of work
 But we could reduce this quantity if we had recourse to the process in vogue in Jersey and Guernsey
 We must also remember that the Paris market-gardener is forced to work so hard because he mostly produces early season fruits, the high prices of which have to pay for fabulous rents, and that this system of culture entails more work than is necessary for growing the ordinary staple-food vegetables and fruit
 Besides, the market-gardeners of Paris, not having the means to make a great outlay on their gardens, and being obliged to pay heavily for glass, wood, iron, and coal, obtain their artificial heat out of manure, while it can be had at much less cost in hothouses
   IV  The market-gardeners, we say, are forced to become machines and to renounce all joys of life in order to obtain their marvellous crops
 But these hard grinders have rendered a great service to humanity in teaching us that the soil can be "made
" They _make_ it with old hot-beds of manure, which have already served to give the necessary warmth to young plants and to early fruit; and they make it in such great quantity that they are compelled to sell it in part, otherwise it would raise the level of their gardens by one inch every year
 They do it so well (so Barral teaches us, in his "Dictionary of Agriculture," in an article on market-gardeners) that in recent contracts, the market-gardener stipulates that he will carry away his soil with him when he leaves the bit of ground he is cultivating
 Loam carried away on carts, with furniture and glass frames--that is the answer of practical cultivators to the learned treatises of a Ricardo, who represented rent as a means of equalizing the natural advantages of the soil
 "The soil is worth what the man is worth," that is the gardeners' motto
  And yet the market-gardeners of Paris and Rouen labour three times as hard to obtain the same results as their fellow-workers in Guernsey or in England
 Applying industry to agriculture, these last make their climate in addition to their soil, by means of the greenhouse
  Fifty years ago the greenhouse was the luxury of the rich
 It was kept to grow exotic plants for pleasure
 But nowadays its use begins to be generalized
 A tremendous industry has grown up lately in Guernsey and Jersey, where hundreds of acres are already covered with glass--to say nothing of the countless small greenhouses kept in every little farm garden
 Acres and acres of greenhouses have lately been built also at Worthing (103 acres in 1912), in the suburbs of London, and in several other parts of England and Scotland
  They are built of all qualities, beginning with those which have granite walls, down to those which represent mere shelters made in planks and glass frames, which cost, even now, with all the tribute paid to capitalists and middlemen, less than 3s
 6d
 per square yard under glass
 Most of them are heated for at least three of four months every year; but even the cool greenhouses, which are not heated at all, give excellent results--of course, not for growing grapes and tropical plants, but for potatoes, carrots, peas, tomatoes, and so on
  In this way man emancipates himself from climate, and at the same time he avoids also the heavy work with the hot-beds, and he saves both in buying much less manure and in work
 Three men to the acre, each of them working less than sixty hours a week, produce on very small spaces what formerly required acres and acres of land
  The result of all these recent conquests of culture is, that if one-half only of the adults of a city gave each about fifty half-days for the culture of the finest fruit and vegetables _out of season_, they would have all the year round an unlimited supply of that sort of fruit and vegetables for the whole population
  But there is a still more important fact to notice
 The greenhouse has nowadays a tendency to become a mere _kitchen garden under glass_
 And when it is used to such a purpose, the simplest plank-and-glass unheated shelters already give fabulous crops--such as, for instance, 500 bushels of potatoes per acre as a first crop, ready by the end of April; after which a second and a third crop are obtained in the extremely high temperature which prevails in the summer under glass
  I gave in my "Fields, Factories, and Workshops," most striking facts in this direction
 Sufficient to say here, that at Jersey, thirty-four men, with one trained gardener only, cultivate thirteen acres under glass, from which they obtain 143 tons of fruit and early vegetables, using for this extraordinary culture less than 1,000 tons of coal
  And this is done now in Guernsey and Jersey on a very large scale, quite a number of steamers constantly plying between Guernsey and London, only to export the crops of the greenhouses
  Nowadays, in order to obtain that same crop of 500 bushels of potatoes, we must plough every year a surface of four acres, plant it, cultivate it, weed, it, and so on; whereas with the glass, even if we shall have to give perhaps, to start with, half a day's work per square yard in order to build the greenhouse--we shall save afterwards at least one-half, and probably three-quarters of the yearly labour required formerly
  These are _facts_, results which every one can verify himself
 And these facts are already a hint as to what man could obtain from the earth if he treated it with intelligence
   V  In all the above we have reasoned upon what already withstood the test of experience
 Intensive culture of the fields, irrigated meadows, the hot-house, and finally the kitchen garden under glass are realities
 Moreover, the tendency is to extend and to generalize these methods of culture, because they allow of obtaining more produce with less work and with more certainty
  In fact, after having studied the most simple glass shelters of Guernsey, we affirm that, taking all in all, far less work is expended for obtaining potatoes under glass in April, than in growing them in the open air, which requires digging a space four times as large, watering it, weeding it, etc
 Work is likewise economized in employing a perfected tool or machine, even when an initial expense had to be incurred to buy the tool
  Complete figures concerning the culture of common vegetables under glass are still wanting
 This culture is of recent origin, and is only carried out on small areas
 But we have already figures concerning the fifty years old culture of early season grapes, and these figures are conclusive
  In the north of England, on the Scotch frontier, where coal only costs 3s
 a ton at the pit's mouth, they have long since taken to growing hot-house grapes
 Thirty years ago these grapes, ripe in January, were sold by the grower at 20s
 per pound and resold at 40s
 per pound for Napoleon III
's table
 To-day the same grower sells them at only 2s
 6d
 per pound
 He tells us so himself in a horticultural journal
 The fall in the prices is caused by the tons and tons of grapes arriving in January to London and Paris
  Thanks to the cheapness of coal and an intelligent culture, grapes from the north travel now southwards, in a contrary direction to ordinary fruit
 They cost so little that in May, English and Jersey grapes are sold at 1s
 8d
 per pound by the gardeners, and yet this price, like that of 40s
 thirty years ago, is only kept up by slack production
  In March, Belgium grapes are sold at from 6d

, while in October, grapes cultivated in immense quantities--under glass, and with a little artificial heating in the environs of London--are sold at the same price as grapes bought by the pound in the vineyards of Switzerland and the Rhine, that is to say, for a few halfpence
 Yet they still cost two-thirds too much, by reason of the excessive rent of the soil and the cost of installation and heating, on which the gardener pays a formidable tribute to the manufacturer and the middleman
 This being understood, we may say that it costs "next to nothing" to have delicious grapes under the latitude of, and in our misty London in autumn
 In one of the suburbs, for instance, a wretched glass and plaster shelter, nine feet ten inches long by six and one-half feet wide, resting against our cottage, gave us about fifty pounds of grapes of an exquisite flavour in October, for nine consecutive years
 The crop came from a Hamburg vine-stalk, six year old
 And the shelter was so bad that the rain came through
 At night the temperature was always that of outside
 It was evidently not heated, for it would have been as useless as heating the street! And the care which was given was: pruning the vine, half an hour every year; and bringing a wheel-barrowful of manure, which was thrown over the stalk of the vine, planted in red clay outside the shelter
  On the other hand, if we estimate the amount of care given to the vine on the borders of the Rhine of Lake Leman, the terraces constructed stone upon stone on the slopes of the hills, the transport of manure and also of earth to a height of two or three hundred feet, we come to the conclusion that on the whole the expenditure of work necessary to cultivate vines is more considerable in Switzerland or on the banks of the Rhine than it is under glass in London suburbs
  This may seem paradoxical, because it is generally believed that vines grow of themselves in the south of Europe, and that the vine-grower's work costs nothing
 But gardeners and horticulturists, far from contradicting us, confirm our assertions
 "The most advantageous culture in England is vine culture," wrote a practical gardener, editor of the "English Journal of Horticulture" in the _Nineteenth Century_
 Prices speak eloquently for themselves, as we know
  Translating these facts into communist language, we may assert that the man or woman who takes twenty hours a year from his leisure time to give some little care--very pleasant in the main--to two or three vine-stalks sheltered by simple glass under any European climate, will gather as many grapes as their family and friends can eat
 And that applies not only to vines, but to all fruit trees
  The Commune that will put the processes of intensive culture into practice on a large scale will have all possible vegetables, indigenous or exotic, and all desirable fruits, without employing more than about ten hours a year per inhabitant
  In fact, nothing would be easier than to verify the above statements by direct experiment
 Suppose 100 acres of a light loam (such as we have at Worthing) are transformed into a number of market gardens, each one with its glass houses for the rearing of the seedlings and young plants
 Suppose also that fifty more acres are covered with glass houses, and the organization of the whole is left to practical experienced French _maraîchers_, and Guernsey or Worthing greenhouse gardeners
  In basing the maintenance of these 150 acres on the Jersey average, requiring the work of three men per acre under glass--which makes less than 8,600 hours of work a year--it would need about 1,300,000 hours for the 150 acres
 Fifty competent gardeners could give five hours a day to this work, and the rest would be simply done by people who, without being gardeners by profession, would soon learn how to use a spade, and to handle the plants
 But this work would yield at least--we have seen it in a preceding chapter--all necessaries and articles of luxury in the way of fruit and vegetables for at least 40,000 or 50,000 people
 Let us admit that among this number there are 13,500 adults, willing to work at the kitchen garden; then, each one would have to give 100 hours a year distributed over the whole year
 These hours of work would become hours of recreation spent among friends and children in beautiful gardens, more beautiful probably than those of the legendary Semiramis
  This is the balance sheet of the labour to be spent in order to be able to eat to satiety fruit which we are deprived of to-day, and to have vegetables in abundance, now so scrupulously rationed out by the housewife, when she has to reckon each half-penny which must go to enrich capitalists and landowners[13]
  If only humanity had the consciousness of what it CAN, and if that consciousness only gave it the power to WILL!  If it only knew that cowardice of the spirit is the rock on which all revolutions have stranded until now
   VI  We can easily perceive the new horizons opening before the social revolution
  Each time we speak of revolution, the face of the worker who has seen children wanting food darkens and he asks--"What of bread? Will there be sufficient, if everyone eats according to his appetite? What if the peasants, ignorant tools of reaction, starve our towns as the black bands did in France in 1793--what shall we do?"  Let them do their worst
 The large cities will have to do without them
  At what, then, should the hundreds of thousands of workers, who are asphyxiated to-day in small workshops and factories, be employed on the day they regain their liberty? Will they continue to shut themselves up in factories after the Revolution? Will they continue to make luxurious toys for export when they see their stock or corn getting exhausted, meat becoming scarce, and vegetables disappearing without being replaced?  Evidently not! They will leave the town and go into the fields! Aided by a machinery which will enable the weakest of us to put a shoulder to the wheel, they will carry revolution into previously enslaved culture as they will have carried it into institutions and ideas
  Hundreds of acres will be covered with glass, and men, and women with delicate fingers, will foster the growth of young plants
 Hundreds of other acres will be ploughed by steam, improved by manures, or enriched by artificial soil obtained by the pulverization of rocks
 Happy crowds of occasional labourers will cover these acres with crops, guided in the work and experiments partly by those who know agriculture, but especially by the great and practical spirit of a people roused from long slumber and illumined by that bright beacon--the happiness of all
  And in two or three months the early crops will receive the most pressing wants, and provide food for a people who, after so many centuries of expectation, will at least be able to appease their hunger and eat according to their appetite
  In the meanwhile, popular genius, the genius of a nation which revolts and knows its wants, will work at experimenting with new processes of culture that we already catch a glimpse of, and that only need the baptism of experience to become universal
 Light will be experimented with--that unknown agent of culture which makes barley ripen in forty-five days under the latitude of Yakutsk; light, concentrated or artificial, will rival heat in hastening the growth of plants
 A Mouchot of the future will invent a machine to guide the rays of the sun and make them work, so that we shall no longer seek sun-heat stored in coal in the depths of the earth
 They will experiment the watering of the soil with cultures of micro-organisms--a rational idea, conceived but yesterday, which will permit us to give to the soil those little living beings, necessary to feed the rootlets, to decompose and assimilate the component parts of the soil
  They will experiment



 But let us stop here, or we shall enter into the realm of fancy
 Let us remain in the reality of acquired facts
 With the processes of culture in use, applied on a large scale, and already victorious in the struggle against industrial competition, we can give ourselves ease and luxury in return for agreeable work
 The near future will show what is practical in the processes that recent scientific discoveries give us a glimpse of
 Let us limit ourselves at present to opening up the new path that consists in _the study of the needs of man, and the means of satisfying them_
  The only thing that may be wanting to the Revolution is the boldness of initiative
  With our minds already narrowed in our youth and enslaved by the past in our mature age, we hardly dare to think
 If a new idea is mentioned--before venturing on an opinion of our own, we consult musty books a hundred years old, to know what ancient masters thought on the subject
  It is not food that will fail, if boldness of thought and initiative are not wanting to the revolution
  Of all the great days of the French Revolution, the most beautiful, the greatest, was the one on which delegates who had come from all parts of France to Paris, worked all with the spade to plane the ground of the Champ de Mars, preparing it for the fête of the Federation
  That day France was united: animated by the new spirit, she had a vision of the future in the working in common of the soil
  And it will again be by the working in common of the soil that the enfranchised societies will find their unity and will obliterate the hatred and oppression which has hitherto divided them
  Henceforth, able to conceive solidarity--that immense power which increases man's energy and creative forces a hundredfold--the new society will march to the conquest of the future with all the vigour of youth
  Ceasing to produce for unknown buyers, and looking in its midst for needs and tastes to be satisfied, society will liberally assure the life and ease of each of its members, as well as that moral satisfaction which work give when freely chosen and freely accomplished, and the joy of living without encroaching on the life of others
  Inspired by a new daring--born of the feeling of solidarity--all will march together to the conquest of the high joys of knowledge and artistic creation
  A society thus inspired will fear neither dissensions within nor enemies without
 To the coalitions of the past it will oppose a new harmony, the initiative of each and all, the daring which springs from the awakening of a people's genius
  Before such an irresistible force "conspiring kings" will be powerless
 Nothing will remain for them but to bow before it, and to harness themselves to the chariot of humanity, rolling towards new horizons opened up by the Social Revolution

 With that the population of the two departments would have all necessary bread, meat, milk, vegetables, and fruit, both for ordinary and even luxurious consumption
 To-day a workman spends for the necessary food of his family (generally less than what is necessary) at least one-third of his 300 work-days a year, about 1,000 hours be it, instead of 290
 That is, he thus gives about 700 hours too much to fatten the idle and the would-be administrators, because he does not produce his own food, but buys it of middlemen, who in their turn buy it of peasants who exhaust themselves by working with bad tools, because, being robbed by the landowners and the State, they cannot procure better ones
